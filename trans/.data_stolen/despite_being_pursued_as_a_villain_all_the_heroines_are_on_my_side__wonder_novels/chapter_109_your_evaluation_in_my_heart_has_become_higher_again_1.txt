In the ward, the old lady took Xiao Ran’s hand and said gratefully, “Young man, thank you for saving this old woman’s life. If it weren’t for you, I might have entered the gate of hell today!”She said while wiping her tears. Taking out a photo of her son, she promised to Xiao Ran that she would definitely bring her son to thank him solemnly.Xiao Ran was shocked when he saw that photo, and then burst into ecstasy.Isn’t the man in the photo the bodyguard who always stays by Su Mingyuan’s side?Although there was a little friction between them, for example, he accidentally hurt him when he went to Su Mingyuan’s company with the intention to find Ruoruo, but it was a harmless thing.Is there any way I can woo him over to my side and make him my covert spy now that I’ve saved his mother?Before Xiao Ran felt that it would be nice to have another undercover agent beside Su Mingyuan. At that time, he thought it was wishful thinking.However, he did not expect that he would be favoured by the goddess of luck, and the old lady he rescued happened to be the mother of Su Mingyuan’s bodyguard.Hehehe, Su Mingyuan, I didn’t expect that your bodyguard will successfully become my accomplice soon.Xiao Ran didn’t even think about whether this could happen.Because when he experienced that wonderful premonition; when he felt God’s blessing, everything turned out to be true.And just when he was complacent about it, a secret video had been delivered to Su Xuelan.As the successor of the Su family, she was actually very busy, so busy that she couldn’t find time to find Mingyuan these two days.However, she had already sent someone to pay close attention to the scenes in the plot of the original novel where Mingyuan’s bodyguard was brought off.So, when Xiao Ran was afraid that his good luck would be robbed, he hurriedly pushed the young man away and ran to give artificial respiration to Li Cheng’s mother, all of which had been completely recorded by her secretly dispatched men.Even if Xiao Ran didn’t choose to rescue him at that time, Su Xuelan’s subordinates would have stood up in time to save Li Cheng’s mother who suddenly had an acute heart attack.That was right, that kind young man was actually Su Xuelan’s subordinate.When receiving this video, Su Xuelan was dealing with the company’s affairs. Seeing it, she smiled faintly, showing the expression that she was in control of everything.But then, she soon stopped laughing.“Where’s Mingyuan, what is he doing now?”“Miss, young master is dating someone from the Xia family. Currently… they seem to be watching a movie together.”The smile on Su Xuelan’s face disappeared immediately.When she was busy at work, Xia Xueqi, the vixen, was secretly eating his tofu…And now she was entangled in affairs and couldn’t get away from it.The second was that she had no valid reason at all to prevent them from dating. After all, Xia Xueqi was his engaged fiancée.Still, the most fundamental question.Identity.However, she was already thinking about solving this problem.After all, she and Mingyuan were not real siblings. They were not related by blood, as long as they could pierce this thin layer.So during this time, every night after she came home from getting off work, she was looking for an opportunity to find a showdown with her parents.She was going to start with mother.At a suitable opportunity, she would tell her mother that she had actually discovered that she was not their biological daughter many years ago by overhearing their conversation and through some clues.After realising this truth, she began to become worried and uneasy, and she felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable when dealing with her family.However, her good brother Mingyuan still treated her as good as ever, but she could no longer look at him in the same way as her younger brother, and a strange feeling for him gradually sprouted in her heart.This relationship made her extremely frightened and afraid, and she could only refuse these feelings with a cold and repulsive attitude. This was why she gradually became estranged from Mingyuan and their relationship turned cold.But, no matter how indifferent, no matter how repulsive, this feeling couldn’t be restrained, especially seeing Mingyuan becoming more indulgent and depraved, seeing him and other girls kissing…Su Xuelan believed that as soon as she would say this, her gentle and kind mother would understand and sympathise with her.At that time, she would beg her mother again, and her mother might be persuaded by her to agree for the matter between her and Mingyuan.They were not real siblings after all.After all, if the two of them could marry, they would become a real family.Even though she wasn’t related by blood to her parents, she would become their real daughter.At that time, she would pull her mother to showdown with father, convince him.Even though she was far behind the others at the moment.Before this plan turned successful, and the blood relationship between her and Su Mingyuan was not broken, the more she came closer to Su Mingyuan, the more it would arouse his rejection and resentment.But, as long as this plan was completed, with the help of her parents, she would win the game.Although she learned that Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi went out on a date again, Su Xuelan’s heart suddenly became a lot more calm when she thought of Xia Xueqi’s angry look after she was overtaken by herself in a corner.Hmph, you fox, I will let you be proud for a while and get some tofu.Anyway, the one who wins in the end will be me!In the cinema.At some point in the movie hall, which was originally air-conditioned, the temperature suddenly seemed to rise.The air became hot and dry, making people’s emotions more sensitive and restless.On the screen, the uncut version of the romantic film had reached the most exciting part.
