“Space-time turbulence is to blame!”At the end of the day, Su Mingyuan could only blame the space-time disturbance that had caused him to return to the current. He sat down, drank the expensive wine that did not taste good at all. Then he reached into the drawer and pulled out a notebook.He just took a peek and put back the notebook. He murmured with a wry smile.“What else should I write in my diary? I penned something last week, but it’s not worth reading at all.”The reason why he kept a diary was because he had no one to talk about his inner distress of acting as a villain last week, so he had to write it in a diary to vent.On the other hand, he also thought of the possibility of someone finding his diary after his death and making the contents public, which would bring trouble to Xiao Ran.After all, he was only the middle boss of “Urban Supremacy Emperor”, a tool man used to promote the feelings of the male and female protagonists and set off the protagonist’s great loftiness.Su Mingyuan, who played the villain, died in the middle of the novel.If his diary could bring Xiao Ran a lot of trouble after his death, it could be that he had to always act as a villain to pretend to force him to face-slapping.At that time, he also asked the system if it could do this, and the system’s answer was: As long as the existence of the system was not exposed, and the diary was not discovered until the end of his villain role, it was not a problem.But he realised it won’t have much effect, Xiao Ran had the aura of the protagonist, who would believe a diary written by a villain?He thought so to himself at the time.Even though this was just for relaxation, Su Mingyuan had kept writing a diary for the last week, writing down everything he did as villain.He still remembered what he wrote at the beginning of the diary.August 5th, sunny weather.For more than 20 years in this novel world, I have been living in a false mask. I am good by nature and do not want to do evil things, but I still generally follow the growth trajectory that the villain “Su Mingyuan” should have, and grew up into a well-known playboy.From the moment I was born, there seemed to be a voice in my ear:I had to play this life that was destined to be face-slapped by the protagonist according to the character of “Su Mingyuan”, otherwise my family and I would die in various accidents, just like the grim reaper who comes in the movie.In this regard, I have always had a deep trepidation and uneasiness in my heart.And this feeling reached its peak the moment I saw Xiao Ruoruo appear today.The plot started.The invisible existence that had warned me from when I was born has reached the peak of existence at this moment too.For the first time, I felt his deep malice towards me, a smuggled transmigrator from another world.It was precisely because of my unexpected appearance that the originally written novel had a slight deviation from the fixed fate.And I have to play my villain role to make up for this deviation, and also to remedy all unexpected situations and situations that arise beyond the script.This is the mission “He” gave me.And I also guessed who “He” really is. He may be the overlord, the mandate of heaven. He set the fate of all people according to the plot of the novel, and all people will live this life step by step under his setting, if it were not for my unexpected appearance.Although the final ending of “Su Mingyuan” is also at the hands of the protagonist Xiao Ran, if I play this role well, at least I can live for two more years, and I will not die immediately.Moreover, Su Mingyuan’s family – my parents and sister in this life have been good to me, and I don’t want them to die because of me.Therefore, I must obey “His” will.I, Su Mingyuan, have to become a loathsome villain.During that time, when he was writing this diary entry, Su Mingyuan couldn’t help thinking in his mind what the expressions of those people would have been like if they had seen his entries.Imagine their shock, panic and regret if they found out the truth.Although the diary’s contents differed from his present situation.He didn’t transmigrate as soon as Su Mingyuan was born, but only transmigrated when the plot was about to start, but when the plot started.He was not forced by the overlord to act as villain in order to save the life of his family, but simply needed to earn to cover the cost of returning home.But it didn’t matter, the overlord would take the blame.He wrote this diary for pleasure. Was he a decent person who writes a diary?However, it was a villain’s diary. I was afraid those who saw the diary would only regard it as his crazy raving.But now, in the face of a catastrophic accident in which the plot changed dramatically as soon as he appeared, he not only lost the desire to write a diary, but also felt a deep sense of helplessness.In order to correct the plot back to the original story line and put everything on the right track, he did not know how much work it would take.It was too hard.…………The moment Xiao Ruoruo turned her back to Su Mingyuan and walked out of the office door, she could no longer hide the sadness in her eyes.After returning from rebirth and once again facing Su Mingyuan’s unreasonable “difficulties”, she only felt a pang of sadness.Su Mingyuan’s diary, which had been hidden at home, was discovered by his sister Su Xuelan shortly after his death in the previous life.And it was from that diary that Su Xuelan learned a shocking and terrifying factSoon, the diary was secretly used by Su Xuelan to show all the harem members to Xiao RanAfter reading all the contents of the diary, they all felt extremely shocked, terrified, and even regretful.Because from there, they learned that all of Su Mingyuan’s actions were forced by the Overlord. For the sake of his family, he had to play a loathsome villain.Even when the plot went wrong and an accident occurred, he had to pretend to be Xiao Ran’s subordinate to save them.And all of them knew that person, after all everyone was saved by him.He wore a white trench coat and covered half of his face with an elegant white mask.His eyes were beautiful, without a trace of evil, and shone as bright as the stars.He said that he was Xiao Ran’s subordinate, and the reason why several of the female protagonists were full of affection for Xiao Ran at the beginning was because his subordinate appeared in time to save them when they were either in danger or in despair.The reason why the remaining female protagonists quickly fell in love with Xiao Ran, in addition to being affected by overlord, was also because they had been saved by Xiao Ran’s subordinate, and this grateful and loving feeling was transferred to Xiao Ran.However, now that the truth had come out, the person who saved them was not Xiao Ran’s subordinateIt was Su Mingyuan, whom they regarded as loathsome in their eyes.They and Xiao Ran personally killed the villain.And the reason why they fell in love with Xiao Ran was also because the overlord had set them to like him.They must follow the plot of the novel, according to the set fate, become his women, become his harem.It’s really… how ridiculous!Yes, they were all the proud women of heaven with a beautiful appearance, if it was not for the influence of the overlord, how could they fall in love with Xiao Ran, or even submit themselves to become his harem.Even if they liked it, they should like Su Mingyuan, who saved them!And Xiao Ran’s misfortune transformed into a blessing, and his unbeatable disadvantage turned out that it was only because he was the main character and the overlord’s pet, and the destined Son of Heaven.They felt some unseen shackles being broken as they read the diary and their hearts were shattered tremendously.Their souls truly awoke after that.In fact, this diary alone was not enough to make them completely sober.The most important reason was that in order to return to the earth with Su Mingyuan’s soul, the system forcibly broke through the world barrier, causing the overlord to be seriously injured. Because of the damage, the aura of the protagonist which belonged to Xiao Ran was shattered.Although he still had a tremendous Heaven’s qi lucky body, he was no longer an invincible and unkillable being.So at the moment of their awakening, the hints exerted by the overlord and the influence of the protagonist’s aura could no longer blind their hearts and eyes.From that moment on, they were no longer characters written in the novel, they were no longer machines that have been set up for everything, they were living people with their own thoughts and wills.Therefore, they would never become Xiao Ran’s women and follow the so-called fate.Except for Xiao Ruoruo, all the female protagonists secretly united and made an amazing decision.Kill Xiao Ran!Since you were the protagonist of the world and the husband that the overlord had arranged for us, then we would kill him and completely end this arranged fate!At the same time, this fate aimed to kill Su Mingyan and push him to remorse.However, Xiao Ruoruo was excluded from the plan and did not participate in it because of the brother-sister relationship with Xiao Ran she had since childhood.After all, Xiao Ran was her brother, who had always been very good to her, and had never harmed her.Although after awakening from her rebirth, Xiao Ruoruo realized that her previous feelings for her brother Xiao Ran were not the love between lovers.Rather, it was because of the influence of the overlord, which alienated her simple sister’s longing and admiration for her brother into such a false emotion.But he was her brother too, and she did not want him to die.To this end, she interceded with a group of heroines for him, and secretly tried many times to block the heroines’ plans against Xiao Ran.However, she would never forget that day.At that time, Xiao Ran’s Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill not only achieved great success, but also comprehended the profound realm of jade beauty.After comprehending this mystery, beauty in his eyes was also a kind of fine jade. The best quality could also help him evolve his divine skills and soar his skills.However, in his original harem, those female protagonists had been estranged from him since they read Su Mingyuan’s diary and covertly conspired to kill him, so that by then, Xiao Ran was still a virgin.But he couldn’t hold back.Especially after secretly finding a few beautiful women to test the waters and prove their feasibility.He finally chose to reach out to Xiao Ruoruo.His younger sister, Xiao Ruoruo’s body innate with yin water, and was high-quality furnace was useful for double cultivation, and he had already vaguely noticed Ruoruo’s love for him.She would never refuse himThat night, Xiao Ran broke into Xiao Ruoruo’s room, and the rippling smile on his face was so obscene and ugly in Xiao Ruoruo’s eyes.“Ruoruo, I already understand your intentions. So tonight, let the two of us truly connect with each other and become one.”He tried to climb on the bed to pick up Xiao Ruoruo’s clothes, but was kicked off the bed by the frightened Xiao Ruoruo, who looked at him in shock and said,“Brother…Brother, what are you talking about, we are siblings!”“Ruoruo, in fact, I have never told you a secret, you are an abandoned baby . Our parents picked you up in the snowy night, and we are actually not related by blood.“Even if we are not related by blood, our relationship is still brother and sister, I’ve always regarded you as my brother. You…you can’t do something that goes against the law…”However, Xiao Ran still climbed into her bed without hesitation.At present, Xiao Ruoruo was so delicate and touching, as well as strikingly beautiful.After having the taste of women, Xiao Ruoruo’s such a superb product made Xiao Ran’s heart itch even more, and he was eager to taste it immediately.“Ruoruo, I know that you just said that you didn’t want to, but in fact, you already wanted to do it with me, and you always liked me, didn’t you?“Don’t… Brother don’tXiao Ruoruo tried her best to resist, but he ignored her resistance and was ready to force her way.“I know, women say no just for modesty If you are assured, I will let you know in no time how comfortable and wonderful it is to do this kind of thing.”Fortunately, Su Xuelan and Xia Xueqi arrived in time to save Xiao Ruoruo from the wolf’s mouth, thus she preserved her innocence from being defiled by Xiao Ran, her clothes were completely worn on her body, without letting Xiao Ran see a trace of spring.But whenever she thought about it, she still felt a wave of fear in her heart.She would never forget that night, when Xiao Ran showed in front of her the obscene ugliness, like a beast wanting to eat people.It turned out that this was his nature.Since then, she no longer opposed or stopped the plan of the rest of the female protagonists in killing Xiao Ran.Just like Su Xuelan, who was once extremely disappointed in Su Mingyuan and finally silently watched Su Mingyuan die at the hands of Xiao Ran.She silently watched the scene of Xiao Ran’s tragic death as the female protagonists joined forces to go down step by step.Then, there was a rebirth.And this time, she would no longer be on Xiao Ran’s sideThe boy who was dressed in white like snow, had good eyes, and had saved her many times, was now being coerced by the overlord and had to play the loathsome villain.Perhaps even because of the influence of her own rebirth, the oppression of the overlord may have become more intense.Because he played the villain so hard this time, he acted even more loathsome and hateful than when she first met him in his previous life.Therefore, when she witnessed him acting like this, she was so angry. And in order to cooperate with his performance, she would force herself to drink wine that she never liked to drink.She couldn’t help it and kissed him painfully.At that moment, the stunned and surprised expression on his face was very cute.That was his real emotion, right?At that moment, that’s who he really was, right?Xiao Ruoruo wanted to continue to stay by Su Mingyuan’s side, she wanted to accompany him silently, and wanted to see more of the real him.Therefore, she made up a reason in front of Xiao Ran that was not very good to investigate in detail.And then, as she expected, Xiao Ran agreed.Because in a sense, she was the one who knew him best.Xiao Ruoruo found Su Mei who had just come out of the conference room after the meeting. After informing her of what Su Mingyuan had told her, she got up and returned to prepare to report to Su Mingyuan.After all, on the surface, she was still Su Mingyuan’s intern secretaryHowever, as soon as she reached the door, she saw a woman who she had not expected.[ADVANCED CHAPTERS:CLICK HERE]
