Su Mingyuan had a serious expression on his face.This isn’t right.Furthermore, Xiao Ruoruo dragged Xiao Ran out of the office — was this to persuade him?Fortunately, Xiao Ran would definitely disagree with her idea.Xiao Ruoruo, on the other hand, was his sole and entire possession.So, it’s hard to believe that he would agree to Xiao Ruoruo’s request to stay by my side.Especially after having just seen my expression.Fortunately, Xiao Ran looked completely fine.As long as he was the one with whom I was familiar, the final results should remain the same.Xiao Ran would put up with his rage and pay me back 2.5 million, after which he would take Xiao Ruoruo away and viciously retaliate against him, “Remember, life is full of ups and downs. Just wait and see, I’ll get back to you as soon as I can!”And with that, the first half of our encounter had come to an end.With Xiao Ruoruo’s situation in mind, I was certain that Xiao Ran would meet my expectations.Because I knew him so well!He would not disappoint me!In the corridor…Xiao Ran tried his best to persuade Xiao Ruoruo, “Ruoruo, I know how much you’re upset that I have to pay that bastard Su Mingyuan with such a large sum of money, but trust me, these two and a half million yuan are nothing compared to your innocence.”“Big brother, I know what you’re capable of. Obviously, you worked extremely hard abroad and earned a lot of money, but 2.5 million yuan is still a big chunk of money for you.”“I don’t want your hard-earned money to go to waste because of my actions…” Xiao Ruoruo expressed, dejected.2.5 million wasn’t much to Xiao Ran, but Xiao Ruoruo didn’t know what he went through when he had been outside the country.She was moved by what he said, but she also didn’t want to give Xiao Ran’s hard-earned money away for nothing.And also…“Big brother, Su Mingyuan… he’s the young master of the Su family and one of the four major families in China, we can’t risk offending him.”“What about the four major families? I invested a lot of time and effort to grow and earn money. With that, Su Mingyuan is absolutely nothing.”“But, big brother, you also said that you needed time to establish, and your relative status is still not enough to face Su Mingyuan, isn’t that right?”Xiao Ruoruo looked up at him.Xiao Ran fell silent.“Besides, big brother, you also know that I was born with yin water. As long as I do not want to, no one can tarnish my innocence,” she continued.Xiao Ruoruo was right.His real name was Xiao Ran, and his parents were descendants of the ancient martial clan of the Xiao family.When the side branches of the Xiao family reached the age of six, the patriarch of the family would engrave them with life and death marks and become his slaves. Since then, the life and death of the slaves would depend on the thoughts of the patriarch.To avoid this tragedy, his parents sent him and his sister to a remote town when he was six years old. Besides, they furtively took the unique skill of the Xiao family — Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill — and told them not to seek revenge until they had mastered studying the skill, then they were killed by the Xiao family.Since then, he and his sister had lived in a welfare home, in which he had changed his name from Xiao Ran, which means free, to Xiao Rán, which means desolate. While taking care of his sick younger sister, he was also mastering the Divine skill.In order to cultivate the Xiao Family’s secret skill — the Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill — not only did it require the cultivator to possess extraordinary talent, but it also required the cultivator to select a precious jade as the keystone of cultivation and practice with it.This jade served as the foundation of that person’s cultivation. Once chosen, it could not be modified.In this way, the cultivator’s talent and the jade that would be selected determine the pace with which the cultivator’s cultivation progresses, the strength of the foundation, and the absolute limit of the cultivator’s cultivation.At the time, Xiao Ran lacked both the skill and the precious jade. As a result, when he began practicing, his cultivation pace was naturally slow, and vengeance for his parents seemed a long way off.However, when he was ten years old, he met an old Taoist priest.This old Taoist claimed that his life was limited, but a son of luck with such a strong destiny before his deathbed unexpectedly met Xiao Ran.The old Taoist stayed, not only did he help Xiao Ran to improve and perfect his Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill, but also discovered at a glance the reason why Xiao Ruoruo was frail and sick.The old Taoist said that her body was innate yin water, but she was born with deficiencies and her physique was imperfect, so he prescribed as long as Xiao Ruoruo took the medicine once a week for twelve years, she will be able to improve her constitution and no longer suffer from complications.And the Pure Jade Divine skill, which had been improved by the old Taoist priest, was even more different from the Xiao family’s Divine skill.The Xiao family’s Divine skill required a piece of precious jade as the keystone for cultivation, and the cultivators also needed to hold jade to cultivate, and once the jade was chosen, it cannot be replaced for life.The improved Pure Jade Divine skill not only could replace jade, but also continuously evolve by absorbing the spiritual energy of a precious jade. With the Pure Jade Divine skill, the cultivator’s true chi was more pure and wonderful, and the foundation was more solid.In fact, the old Taoist’s version of Pure Jade Divine skill had an endless capacity for improvement as well as a terrifying potential that would exceed even more.Compared to this, the Xiao Family’s Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill could only be described as the beggar version, whereas this was the genuine Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill.Ten days later, the old Taoist passed away unexpectedly. In such an instant, he witnessed the cold body of the old Taoist dissolve into a white rainbow and vanish in front of his eyes like mist. Only he realized he had met a Taoist immortal.And what he obtained was big luck!A few years after that, he went abroad to work hard and collected all kinds of precious jade to continue to evolve his true chi, and his strength skyrocketed until he became the ‘King of Assassins’.The reason why he returned to China this time was because he had already run a huge network of influences and relationships abroad, and it was time to come back to seek revenge for the Xiao family.Another reason was that the precious jade he had collected abroad no longer improved his Pure Jade Divine skill.Although those precious jades were definitely precious, he knew that the true rare treasures — the kind of heavenly treasures that were said to have intercepted a trace of ancient spiritual energy — could be found in his main country!For example… that dragon essence jade Su Mingyuan wears all year round around his waist.And the reason why he was at ease to go abroad was that the old Taoist priest told him before he died,Although Xiao Ruoruo’s innate decoction of yin water was a high-quality furnace used for double cultivation, if she isn’t willing, then those who futilely attempt to her body would all be frozen in the last step. The breath of yin freezes that person’s body and soul.Now Xiao Ruoruo suddenly mentioned this matter, apparently to make Xiao Ran feel at ease.However…As long as the last step was not reached, this defense mechanism will not be triggered — but who knows whether Su Mingyuan’s beast would take advantage of Ruoruo?This was also the reason why he came here immediately after he learned the news from Brother Yang, even if he knew that her sister was impossible to be completely violated.“Ruoruo, even so, I still don’t agree.”“Brother, I will protect myself. Didn’t Su Mingyuan threaten you with surveillance cameras just now? If I also learn this trick, as long as he wants to do something wrong to me, I will take out my phone and gather evidence.”“No matter how arrogant and domineering Su Mingyuan is, he has to act according to the rules and the law, right? And I’m not one of those women who are blinded by his money. As long as I don’t obey him and have evidence in my hands, he can’t do anything to me! And in this way, my liquidated damages and your compensation, brother, don’t have to be paid…”This explanation was not very acceptable to Xiao Ran, but Xiao Ruoruo’s next sentence made him completely confused.“Su Mingyuan is a villain. Bullying my brother like that just now, I must find an opportunity to get revenge on him. Also, brother, if Su Mingyuan will scheme against you in the future, I can secretly report to you!”“By the way, don’t you need a top-quality precious jade to practice your Divine skill? If I secretly snatch the jade on his waist for you in the last few days of my internship, it will definitely make him very angry, right?”As soon as these words came out, Xiao Ran fell into complete silence.The dragon essence jade on Su Mingyuan’s waist, if my sister gave it to me, I don’t know how much more skill it could make me grow…And if Ruoruo was by his side, she could always tip me off…He felt confused and emotional at the same time.He didn’t notice that his tangled appearance completely fell into Xiao Ruoruo’s eyes.Seeing his heart-wrenching look, Xiao Ruoruo lowered her head in disappointment and whispered in her heart,I knew it would be like this, brother, you and I were deceived by Su Mingyuan in my past life. Although he was a complete villain, you would always spoil me.Hehe, turns out I was wrong, everything is just fate and the ending is determined by the overlord.Fortunately, God has mercy on me and let me be reborn. Now I am not the heroine in this novel, I have my own will and soul.So brother, this time, I won’t hurt him again. Please forgive me, I won’t be on your side anymore.
