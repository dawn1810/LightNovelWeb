“Fire me? Don’t worry, Ruoruo, President Xia won’t listen to that dude. She has always disliked him!”On the other end of the phone, Xiao Ran smiled confidently.Xiao Ruoruo also had a false smile on her face and said, “Big brother, since that’s the case, then I’m relieved.”She hung up. However, the fake smile on Xiao Ruoruo’s face disappeared instantly.Hearing the upturned tone of Xiao Ran just now, it was obvious that he was very happy to be informed about this matter as his undercover agent.Plan accomplished!She joyfully waved her small fist in celebration of her accomplishment.And her traitorous smug look was caught by Su Mingyuan’s eyes.His probe was indeed correct that Xiao Ruoruo would tip off Xiao Ran as soon as she returned to her room.All the conversations between the two of them were heard in the monitoring room, as clear as they were talking in his ear.And now, he was finally sure of it.Xiao Ruoruo really wanted to be an undercover agent!Although some details were unclear and some of her abnormal behaviours still could not be reasonably explained.But the truth was right in front of his own eyes, and also two times in a row!So, there was no doubt that Xiao Ruoruo was an undercover agent!Strong undercover!This was what he saw with his own eyes!What about brother Mingyuan, brother Mingyuan…She called him brother Mingyuan, but she was still thinking of his brother Xiao Ran.He’s your real brother, your lover, right?At this point, Su Mingyuan was 100% sure of what he figured.The next…..Su Mingyuan clapped his hands with excitement.Perfect!Great!It’s perfect!As the plot proceeded, there would have been several undercover agents from Xiao Ran by his side.He also worried about how to make these undercover agents appear smoothly according to the plot in case the plot changed.And now there’s one that’s already made!In the future, when he planned to deal with Xiao Ran in private according to the plot, he didn’t need to prepare Xiao Ran in advance to inform him , it was enough for Xiao Ruoruo to be by his side!‘Ruoruo, you are really a treasure!’‘You can give me benefits again. You are also working undercover for Xiao Ran for free to help me correct the plot.’‘I really like you!’Oh, that’s right! Tomorrow, there would be a scene where Xiao Ran will be humiliated, but on the other hand, he would be slapped on the face, so why not bring her along?Just think of that exciting scene!What happened was, he, as the fiancé of Xiao Ran’s immediate boss, arrogantly ordered his fiancée to fire Xiao Ran in front of all the company’s staff. Behind Xiao Ran was his younger sister, who stayed overnight at his house tonight!However, at the moment of Xiao Ran’s extreme humiliation, Xia Xueqi would suddenly rebuke, not Xiao Ran, but Su Mingyuan!In front of all Xuanmei employees, and under the watchful eyes of everyone, Xia Xueqi, the fiancée of dignified Su family’s younger master, Su Mingyuan, even reprimanded him for another man, especially that person he wanted to humiliate!More importantly, he thought he had grasped Xiao Ran’s younger sister and brought her to Xiao Ran to show off and humiliate her.However, in reality, Xiao Ruoruo was Xiao Ran’s undercover agent, and she had already told Xiao Ran everything.Everything he did today had been anticipated by Xiao Ran before it happened!And he, Su Mingyuan,  was an impotence in Xiao Ran’s eyes, a piece of trash who relied on women to show off and prove he was not infertile!He brought Xiao Ruoruo to humiliate Xiao Ran, but he didn’t know that he was the one who would be completely humiliated!Such a story, such a development.From Xiao Ran’s point of view, wasn’t it cool enough for such a classic desire to be promoted first to be suppressed, a huge reversal, and the contrast between the bright and the dark?Had he, Su Mingyuan, been hit in the face by two women?Whether it was his fiancée Xia Xueqi, whom he thought would listen to him, or Xiao Ruoruo, who was secretly in fact Xiao Ran’s undercover agent.Before Xiao Ran could make a move, the existence and performance of the two of them have completely made Xiao Ran pretend to be a big guy, and compared with him, Su Mingyuan was a clown-like existence!#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovel.comOMG!It’s perfect!Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan couldn’t imagine how amazing he would get villain points from the system after completing such a performance!He didn’t expect that Xiao Ruoruo’s change would not only not spoil his business, but also cooperate with Xiao Ran and play a big role, making his performance more dramatic and impactful!Nice job, Xiao Ruoruo!‘Tomorrow, tomorrow I will definitely take you with me.’Without you, my excellent performance would have lost a lot of color.Su Mingyuan beautifully opened his computer, clicked on a mysterious software and browsed the beauty portraits inside.This was a software that only the rich and young in China were qualified to log in. Every girl in it was said to be beautiful, the face value of at least ninety or more.Their photos and their own faces were exactly the same, not photoshop or beautified faces.And the family was clean, no bad habits, no medical history.This software was used by the rich and powerful young men to choose a concubine, Su Mingyuan  wanted to experience the feeling of using it for a long time.He, Su Mingyuan, was a well-known dude in the Mingcapital.

He said to her with a smile, “When that moment comes, you must behave well. Do not disappoint me.”“Brother Mingyuan, what are you talking about?”Xiao Ruoruo opened her eyes wide and looked at him suspiciously.Su Mingyuan had already hummed a small tune, put Xiao Ruoruo to the side, and was also enjoying the food.With the prospect of earning a huge number of villain points and strengthening the progress toward going home, he was in a fantastic mood.At night, he forgot to continue testing Xiao Ruoruo to see how much she could sacrifice to be Xiao Ran’s undercover agent.But the days were long, and he had time to explore this.No hurry, he could play with her slowly.Su Mingyuan fell asleep with anticipation and joy.As the moon slowly rolled over to the other side of the earth, the sun gently woke him up.It was the second day.Let him, Su Mingyuan, take the centre stage again for the villain’s second performance.Let the show start!***
