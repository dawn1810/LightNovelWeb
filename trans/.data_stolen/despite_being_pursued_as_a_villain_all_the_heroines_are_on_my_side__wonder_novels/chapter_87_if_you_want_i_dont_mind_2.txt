Xia Xueqi’s voice suddenly paused, and her tone softened, “Forget it, it’s nothing, if you don’t want to, then don’t do it. Xiao Ran, I don’t want to put any pressure on you, you can do it according to your own ideas. Good. Whatever choice you make, I don’t blame you.”The phone hung up, Xia Xueqi’s voice showed a rare tenderness at the last moment.However, she said that she did not want to put pressure on Xiao Ran, no matter what choice he made, she would not blame him.But when these words fell in Xiao Ran’s ears, they echoed in his heart, and cut his flesh like soft tofu.Could he really stick with his neck without apologising and let Xia Xueqi’s efforts and hardships be in vain?And because of this, he would be completely disconnected from Murong Hongxue, making his security business unable to start…Isn’t it just to hold back for a while, is it really that difficult, can’t I really let go of that poor self-esteem?Perhaps, he should really let go of his pride, let go of the arrogance of the King of Killers, and apologise to Su Mingyuan…Xiao Ran looked at the sky and sighed, his clenched fist slowly loosened.He hadn’t made a decision to apologise to Su Mingyuan, and the remaining self-respect and unyielding in his heart did not allow him to bow down to such a bastard.But the balance in his heart, at this time, has unconsciously tilted towards the side of apologising.…………And just when Xiao Ran was suffering in his heart.Su Mingyuan’s heart was also tortured.When Ruoruo went to the kitchen to cook, Su Xuelan immediately came closer, hugged his arms with both hands, and tucked his arms between her deep ravines intimately.This, this… Is this the kind of intimacy between siblings!However, Su Xuelan didn’t seem to care at all, thinking that it was normal, and made fun of him in turn.“Mingyuan, siblings are supposed to be so close, there are no secrets. Could it be that you are… having crooked thoughts? Are you tempted by your sister’s body?”“No, no, sister, you think too much.” Su Mingyuan quickly denied it.There was a playful smile on the corner of Su Xuelan’s mouth. Leaning in his arms, her slender jade hand gently and provocatively caressed his chest.“Mingyuan, if you’re actually curious about your sister’s body…”She winked at him charmingly, her bright red lips opened and closed, as if she was inviting something.“…… oK.”That playful and seductive tone, those seductive lips, those charming eyes that shone with infinite charm…Shit!Sister! What are you doing?Is this the tone you should have?Give me back your usual gentle, dignified, elegant and noble appearance!“Sister, you… don’t tease me, I’m really not that kind of person!”If only you were such a person!Su Xuelan covered the sadness in her heart, hugged him with a smile, tickled his arms with both hands, raised her face and looked at him dotingly. “No matter what kind of person you are, Mingyuan, I will accept it with infinite tolerance.”“So… if you really have such thoughts in the future, I really don’t mind…”She flicked Su Mingyuan’s forehead, leaned over and kissed his cheek with a smile, “After all, if I don’t give it to my dearest brother, should I go and cheapen those people outside?”It’s over, it’s over, it’s over!Sister, please don’t say that, don’t tease me like that!I am also a normal man with normalphysiological needs.Always being so teased by a peerless beauty like you, I am really afraid that one day I will not be able to bear it!I’m even a little fucked up right now!You… don’t mess around like this, we’re siblings!At this time, Su Mingyuan was very panicked, his heartbeat was fast, and his scalp was even a little numb.Because just now, under the teasing of Su Xuelan, he was really a little…Where is Ruoruo?Where is Ruo Ruo? Only you can save me!Now I desperately need your kiss to quench my thirst and forget those ridiculous and taboo thoughts that popped into my head.If you are done cooking, come and save me first!Then, Su Xuelan took Su Mingyuan to find Ruoruo.Of course, she didn’t plan to let Su Mingyuan and Ruoruo meet, but she planned to lean against the kitchen door with Su Mingyuan.While snuggling in his arms like this, she continued to tease him, watching him show a cute face with red cheeks.While watching Ruoruo preparing breakfast for her, she saw her blushing face as she heard the actions and voices of the two of them.And what about Su Mingyuan?He couldn’t stand it anymore!What a shame!He felt that if she continued like this, his low moral bottom line might continue to slide uncontrollably into the abyss until one day he would broke through the boundaries of taboos.He didn’t want this!Especially in front of Ruoruo!He managed to get Ruoruo’s favour, so that she was willing to help her.Su Mingyuan even felt that if Ruoruo seemed to have gotten a little too deep into the drama now, he was really going to fall into it…As a result, Su Xuelan suddenly making such a move in front of her, and his previous efforts were all going in vain.He also wanted to make Ruoruo fall in love with him, so that she would be able to follow his arrangements and orders perfectly, to ensure the perfection of every performance, and she could also put on white silk to help him…In short, Su Mingyuan broke free from Su Xuelan’s embrace.Shameful escape.Su Xuelan never imagined this. She thought she could further explore the boundaries between siblings with Mingyuan during this day, and she could also make fun of Ruoruo to let her know who was the real master of the palace.But……When a straight line between perfect two points becomes a solid triangle.Things didn’t turn out as she expected.She wanted to get close to Su Mingyuan. She was not only satisfied with the normal hugs between siblings, but wanted to explore more, preferably in front of Ruoruo…Su Mingyuan was a little afraid that if he was too close to her, he would cross the line, and he felt that it was not very good to show such excessive intimacy between him and his sister in front of Ruoruo, and at the same time, he kept thinking about Ruoruo’s white silk…Ruoruo really wanted to be intimate with Su Mingyuan, but Su Xuelan was now pitifully cowardly, and she also felt that it was not good to kiss brother Mingyuan in front of Su Xuelan. Moreover, she was very shy…These three people chased and escaped, almost forming a perfect closed loop, resulting in no one getting the result they wanted all day long.Su Xuelan was full of confidence at the beginning, feeling that it was her turn to shine.But she never thought that Mingyuan could accept Ruoruo’s kiss and a date with Xia Xueqi, but he was such a traditional man in his heart.He couldn’t accept the behaviour of being too intimate with her!All day, apart from hugging and touching, she still didn’t get a kiss from Mingyuan!It was really hard to start as a sister!Although the previous teasing made Mingyuan seem to be a little loose, but really waiting for him to make up his mind to break through the boundaries, it would take an unimaginable time.Su Xuelan was secretly ruthless at this moment.Definitely, she must find an opportunity as soon as possible to let their parents break through the fact that they were not related by blood in front of Mingyuan.Otherwise, the relationship between her and Mingyuan would always be stuck at this step and unable to make progress!On this day, neither Xiao Ran nor Su Mingyuan, nor Murong Hongxue, Su Xuelan or Ruoruo, got what they wanted.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe only one who thought this day was very normal was Xia Xueqi who was quietly admiring the photos at the moment.She had already started to plan for her next date with Su Mingyuan.***
