Dashing!Handsome!Eye-catching!When Su Mingyuan walked down the street in a white knight suit and saw people looking at him with surprise, he knew that his outfit had completely won them over.He did not feel the least bit of shame or embarrassment.Silly?He had done so many things in this outfit the previous week that he had grown accustomed to it.Shame? It does not exist in my dictionary.After walking a few steps against the gazes of the people around, Su Mingyuan immediately unleashed his Radiant Jade True Qi, and his entire body transformed into a rapid black shadow and vanished on the street, leaving behind a shower of dust.Ahem, I’m in a hurry because of this business, not because I haven’t worn this suit in a while and feel a little uncomfortable……………Inside the Chinese-style study room.In front of the huge desk, Murong Hongxue dipped her brush in ink and wrote a big word on the paper: CALM!Few people knew that Murong Hongxue, an underground queen and femme fatale whose hands were stained with blood of countless peoples, had a secret passion for calligraphy.Whenever she had to make a critical decision or felt anxious, she would enter her study, pick up a brush and ink, and use them as a conductor to transfer the emotions in her heart.Calligraphy could bring calmness to any chaotic mind.So, Murong Hongxue also needed to use this hobby to suppress the desire to kill in her heart.Because she had the urge to write “KILLl”. It was the most used word in the study room.But at this moment, she felt restless and wrote the word “CALM” only because that person appeared.Even though she behaved impeccably last night, as if she didn’t know him at all, and all she did was act according to her own personality and logic.But she couldn’t deceive herself.When she saw Su Mingyuan for the first time, her heart raced and her emotions were all over the place. Even now she could not calm down.However, she had to suppress this emotion because she was afraid of doing something wrong, as well as she knew how irrational in the state of her craziness.This was already the 103rd “CALM” word she wrote today.“The handwriting is good, and the iron painting silver hook looks like it has been practised, but there’s still something lacking.”Just then, Su Mingyuan suddenly appeared in front of her like a shadow. He looked handsome in his white windbreaker, with a white mysterious mask and a slightly unruly smile.Murong Hongxue suppressed her wildly beating heart and looked at him with cold eyes, a hint of murderous aura flashed past them, “Who are you ……?”“Miss Murong, your guard here seems a little short… Of course, I’m not here to tell you about it.”The corners of Su Mingyuan’s mouth were slightly upturned as if he had not noticed Murong Hongxue’s eyes which were alert and full of killing intent.He took a brush from her desk, dipped it in ink, and slid it down, writing large letters, as if it was his own home.Calm!Strong and powerful, simple and natural, but it also conveyed tranquillity and gentleness.Compared to the words she wrote, it was like a sand painting made by a child on the beach with a twig!“Miss Murong, I wonder if my clumsy work can give me a few minutes to talk? ”Su Mingyuan had a modest look on his lips as if he was talking about a piece of crap.Looking at Murong Hongxue’s expression which failed to hide its astonishment, the corner of his mouth could not help but turn upwards, and his heart was filled with satisfaction.With his handwriting, how could the word “CALM” be clumsy?Seeing Murong Hongxue staring at him with eyes, which seemed to be tinged with respect?!This was the master’s legacy, and just the word he wrote was enough for skilled calligraphers to give him a lot of respect.Su Mingyuan was in high heavens right now.No one would recognize him in this white knight suit, and he could play to his heart’s content with the various master skills he bought from the system and pretend to be a master.Moreover, Murong Hongxue, the underworld queen, was still pretentious.This feeling ……This is so refreshing!Murong Hongxue gazed at the word again for a long time, the killing intent in her eyes gradually faded away. She turned her head to him and said in a flat tone, “For the sake of this word, I will not pursue the matter of your trespassing in my study room for the time being. Tell me, what do you want to talk to me about?”#[email protected]“Naturally, it’s about last night.” Su Mingyuan had a mysterious smile as he slowly spoke, “I know what you, Murong Hongxue has always wanted to do, and Xiao Ran can be your helper, he can help you accomplish that thing ……”Speaking of this, his voice lowered, and his magnetic voice carried more mystery, slowly revealing her ambition.… “Overthrow or take control of the ancient martial family, Murong family.”Bang!The inkstand was knocked over, and the black ink left a large patch of thick black stain on the snow-white rice paper. Murong Hongxue’s eyes appeared to have a trace of madness, as if someone touched her reverse scales. She suddenly stepped forward to grab Su Mingyuan’s collar.“Who the hell …… are you!”“And what do you know ……!”Killing intent!Overwhelming killing intent!Of course Su Mingyuan knew why Murong Hongxue was so angry.Because of his words just now, he once again scratched upon her deepest wounds.#[email protected]Murong Hongxue’s mother was a…prostitute.Her birth was a complete accident.His father was so ecstatic that night that he forgot to bring a condom, and her mother was knocked out in bed and slept all day. When she woke up, she had forgotten to take birth control, so she was pregnant with her.But her mother did not know who her father was, and then gave birth to her.A few years later, she died, and Murong Hongxue was only saved from starvation by the occasional kindness of one of her mother’s co-worker.Before the age of eight, she lived in the darkest ditch, in the darkest world. She had no place to live, no family, and even the most destitute beggar and the poorest homeless ridiculed her.#[email protected]They mocked her prostitute mother, mocked her for being a bastard child born from a whore, and mocked her for being incredibly dirty and ugly from birth.Even so, by stealing and snatching, enduring countless ridicule and scolding, she survived with great difficulty.Until the age of eight, a passing Murong family elder sensed that she had Murong family bloodline and brought her back to the Murong family.
