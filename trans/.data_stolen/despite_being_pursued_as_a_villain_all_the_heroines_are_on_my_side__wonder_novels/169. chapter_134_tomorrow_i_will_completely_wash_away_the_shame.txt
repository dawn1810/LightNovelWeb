After the incident, Su Mingyuan lay on the sofa with a calm face and looked up at the sky.Man is such a stupid creature that can be easily controlled by desire.He commented very calmly.Therefore, I could not withstand the temptation of Ruoruo, which is also a very reasonable thing.Besides, if it wasn’t because I really liked it, how could I be attracted to Ruoruo so easily?If I just find a woman on the street and put on white silk to show me, I promise not to be moved. I won’t even bother to glance at it!At that time, Ruoruo had already blushed with shyness, and rushed into her room to wash her clothes.Su Mingyuan took out his mobile phone after being satisfied and passed the time in boredom.Suddenly, the latest news from Liu Mengning’s social platform came into view.[I have been very interested in painting recently. I just saw the heroic story of an unsung hero saving lives today, so I drew it as inspiration. Let’s cheer for this hero together!]The picture posted in the dynamic was the picture of Liu Mengning with paint on her face standing next to the drawing board.In the photo, she only showed a small half of her face, and the whole painting occupied the most central position and the largest space.Under the dynamic, countless messages piled up like the number of sand in the river. The one that was pushed to the top was a comment that was liked by Liu Mengning herself. “This world is so beautiful because there are such unsung heroes. Cheer to the heroes!”In just an hour, the number of likes had already reached tens of thousands.Not only that, many celebrities in the entertainment industry had forwarded this news, and they have swiped the TAG of “Cheer for the hero”, and they have quickly put this news on the hot search.Su Mingyuan was only a little popular at first, but now with the news of Liu Mengning, plus many celebrity V’s retweeting, and then the two videos of his singing on the flyover were turned over. Even today, a video of singing and his action of saving a life was just filmed and posted online…Mysterious, handsome, singing like the sound of nature, and the most important thing was the scene where he rescued the little boy unrestrainedly like a hero in the movie.He was completely on fire.Although it might be short-lived, at least today, he had really exploded on the Internet.Countless people questioned his origins, and countless people longed to know the true face under his mask.And this should belong to the treatment of the protagonist Xiao Ran.According to the original story, the process of his rescue of Liu Mengning today would be accidentally filmed and posted on the Internet.This video did not cause much sensation at first, until some good people pointed out that the woman in sunglasses who was rescued in the video was very likely to be the big star Liu Mengning. It suddenly caused widespread discussion and dissemination.After that, the popularity continued to ferment, and Xiao Ran made a cameo appearance in a new movie prepared by Liu Mengning, which completely confirmed the speculation. His dashing skills had quickly built up an excellent reputation for him in the eyes of Chinese audiences in a short period of time.And the villain Su Mingyuan, who constantly opposed him in the whole process, was like a clown to set off him.It should haave been like this.But……Xiao Ran regretted that he had no chance to save Liu Mengning today, and no one cared about what he did today.Under the guidance of Liu Mengning, everyone’s eyes, everyone’s praise, all gathered on his white knight, Su Mingyuan!Really, do you have to make it so big?Su Mingyuan quietly watched Liu Mengning’s post that caused an uproar in the film and television industry.His mood fluctuated violently.Last week, Liu Mengning didn’t do this for Xiao Ran, but just let the video lie there and ferment quietly, but this week…As if she had obtained the most precious treasure, she couldn’t help shouting loudly for everyone to look over, wishing to tell everyone, wishing to show off to the world:You see, this is the hero in my mind, how handsome, mysterious and powerful he is!But… hum, he belongs to me, you are only allowed to look at it, begging me is useless, I will not let you!This damn sweet woman originally used black magic on me. Luckily, Ruoruo’s soft white silk feet drived you away from my mind, but you sneaked into my heart again, and insisted on living there without leaving.Oh, what else can I do?I can only say that my heart is big enough and spacious enough to be divided into many pieces.One for Ruoruo, one for Xueqi, one for Hongxue, and one for you.If you want to live, then live!Just wait, Liu Mengning, one day I will come back, I will come back to live in your heart, and hold everything about you in my palm!Su Mingyuan got up from the sofa, left the villa, put on the white knight suit in a corner where no one was around, and set off.Tomorrow was Liu Mengning’s film investment meeting, and the fifth performance would begin.He had to go to Xiao Ran first, so that he could follow his true nature and play well tomorrow, and not lose the chain like the last one.Then go to Liu Mengning again.He left in a hurry before, and he forgot to ask her to choose Xiao Ran as her new film investor tomorrow, to finalise the fact and nail the ending of the show.At that time, there would be no problem with Xiao Ran, and the ending of the performance would be perfectly developed according to the plot of the novel. Can he, Su Mingyuan, not get a high rating from the system this time?That was definitely not possible.His previous shame, which could only hover on the edge of passing and failing, would be completely washed away in this performance!Oh yes, I almost forgot my sister Su Xuelan.She also needs to ensure that she will not interfere with her performance at that time.After all, this kind of thing has happened once, and I must take precautions in advance.I was almost careless.Suu Mingyuan touched his chest in fear, and immediately called Su Xuelan.“Sister, that, I’m sorry, this time I’m asking you something else…”After Su Xuelan calmly listened to Su Mingyuan’s request, she did not agree immediately, but asked lightly, “Mingyuan, do you only take the initiative to call me when you have something to ask from me? Although I definitely won’t refuse, after so many days, you haven’t even called me to greet me. Do you know how sad I feel in my heart?”Although her tone was flat, it was full of sadness and grievance.Don’t think of me only when you need me, Mingyuan!Listening to the grievances in Su Xuelan’s words, Su Mingyuan also felt that he was going too far. He just relied on Su Xuelan’s doting on him to treat her as a tool, and only think of her when needed.Humans are not machines, they need emotional lubrication. Usually, he should pay attention to Su Xuelan.Wiping the cold sweat on his forehead, he quickly apologised sincerely. “I’m sorry, sister, it’s my fault. I’ll call you first every morning when I wake up, please be safe…”Only then did Su Xuelan reluctantly show a smile, and she said with some dissatisfaction, “You only promised me last time that you would be free to come home and stay for a few days, but it’s been so long. You still stay in your villa every day, Ruoruo that little girl really makes you linger like that?”I’m afraid that if I go home, I will be hugged every day by my sister who doesn’t care about men’s and women’s line. If something happened, wouldn’t that be a heinous crime?After all, we didn’t really grow up together, I can not really ignore your beauty like a younger brother.Although I regard you as a sister in my heart, I am really afraid that I can’t stand it because my skin is glued with a peerless beauty like you!“Mingyuan, come home and stay for a few days in two days. Mom misses you too.” At that time, Su Xuelan added another bargaining chip, and her tone was full of indifference.She took out the majesty of being an older sister.This time, Su Mingyuan couldn’t refuse completely, so he had to agree.After tomorrow’s performance, he would home and stay for a few days.Thinking of her mother, her sister shouldn’t be too presumptuous in front of her.Just those few days…Maybe I can’t find the good baby Ruoruo to help me, so I have to solve it in private.As a man with strong vitality, this was also a small trouble he has to face.On the other side, Su Xuelan put down the phone, and there was a hint of excitement and anticipation in her eyes.Ah, after Mingyuan returns home, I can finally be with him to the fullest, finally have the opportunity to completely break our sibling relationship, and then with the permission and blessing of my mother…Thinking of the sweet pictures after that, Su Xuelan couldn’t help showing a happy and expectant smile.Don’t look at the progress of her relationship with Mingyuan at the moment, but she would soon climb out, take the lead, and completely exceed everyone.Xia Xueqi and Murong Hongxue, huh, at that time, they can only eat the vinegar of my old lady!…………After chatting casually with Liu Xi in the coffee shop, Xiao Ran returned to the company and sat in his office until now.He was waiting for someone.Someone he expected.Just because that person said that he would come to him at night, he decided to sit here and wait until the evening.“Boss! Oh, no, Mr. Xiao!” The younger brother who came in to report the letter quickly changed his name and said respectfully, “Your junior brother is looking for you downstairs.”Junior Brother?!Xiao Ran’s eyes suddenly lit up, his expression unconsciously had a little joy, and he hurried downstairs.Unexpectedly, the person he was waiting for had already arrived before the night!
