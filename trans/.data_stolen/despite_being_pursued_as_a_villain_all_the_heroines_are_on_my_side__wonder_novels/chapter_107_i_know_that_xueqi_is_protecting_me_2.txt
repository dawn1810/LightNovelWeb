At this moment, Xiao Ran hoped that in addition to the undercover Ruoruo, there was another loyal undercover beside Su Mingyuan.If Ruoruo was just his secretary after all, she would not follow him anytime and anywhere.For example, in this situation, she was not there.Therefore, the undercover agent should preferably be Su Mingyuan’s bodyguard, who could report Su Mingyuan’s whereabouts and plans to him in real time.The most important thing was to be able to let him know whether Su Mingyuan touched her when she was dating Xueqi.Even as a last resort, the undercover bodyguard might find a way to find an excuse to stop Su Mingyuan’s aggression against Xue Qi.Of course, these might also be due to his overthinking. After all, Su Mingyuan didn’t have that ability, and maybe he was not very interested in that aspect. The hype about finding women to play with women in Mingjing was just to cover up some flaws.After all, if Ruo Ruo had been with him for so long, she was still fine, and she had not been violated, wasn’t she?And those who could become Su Mingyuan’s bodyguards must be loyal to him, and if they want to subdue one of them as their undercover agent, how could there be such a good thing?Xiao Ran laughed at himself, and left the movie theatre in a state of dismay, only to accidentally bump into someone before he took a few steps.“Which wild dog dares to stand in the way of this young master?”Xia Rongze, who just came out of the restaurant, was in a bad mood.As soon as he learned that his sister Xia Xueqi was in the same restaurant as him, he felt uncomfortable as if he had triggered ptsd, and trembled in fear.He was going to play some excitement with the woman he had just found in the box, but the shadow of Xia Xueqi always lingered in his mind, so frightened that he didn’t harden up for a long time, so he had to deal with it casually and leave unhappily.In the end, he didn’t expect to leave the restaurant, and before he took a few steps, a wild dog with no long eyes ran into him.He was instantly angry, and he didn’t bother to care who the other party was, so he raised his foot towards Xiao Ran’s leather shoes and stepped on it viciously.Anyway, no matter who it is, they don’t dare to provoke him, the son of the Xia family.Not to mention the bodyguards behind him!“Let you, a wild dog, dare to block my way, let you, a wild dog, dare to block my way!”While stepping on it hard, he also made an arrogant voice, which made Xiao Ran angry to the sky!The experience in the movie theatre just now made him very uncomfortable, and he held a sigh of relief in his heart.As a result, as soon as he went out, he was insulted by the wicked young master of the rich family while stepping on his leather shoes.Take a closer look, the good guy was still the playful brother Xia Rongze that Xueqi hated the most!Sure enough, there were people from the Su and Xia family all over the place. Xia Rongze saw me at the date where his sister and Su Mingyuan were dating. He was afraid that I would destroy their marriage, so he bumped up in a bad mood to find an excuse to humiliate them. Am I that easy to bully?It is good!Very good!I, Xiao Ran, endured Su Xuelan because she currently controls most of the Su family’s power and can’t afford to offend her temporarily.I, Xiao Ran, endured Su Mingyuan, because the Su and Xia family put pressure on me, my power has not developed, and I need to admit counselling for the time being.But you Xia Rongze, such a wasteful second-generation ancestor who eats and waits to die, also sees me being bullied and humiliating me?The humiliation he suffered before, the suffocation and discomfort in the movie theatre just now. This series of emotions accumulated together, and finally turned into the deepest anger, igniting the flame of revenge in Xiao Ran’s heart!Just after absorbing the spiritual jade sent by his junior brother yesterday, his Radiant Jade True Qi was further condensed and strengthened, and even a mysterious change appeared, it became scorching hot. In game terms, it seems to have added fire attribute damage.Today, I will simply use it to retaliate against Xia Rongze!He let Xia Rongze step on his feet, tucked his palms into his sleeves, then stretched out his fingers and shot out two Radiant Jade True Qi at Xia Rongze’s waist, where his kidneys and lower body were located from an angle that no one else could see.Puff! Puff!The two rays of infuriating energy shot straight into Xia Rongze’s kidneys and lower body, making a very small sound, so slight that even Xia Rongze didn’t notice it.He didn’t even know that there were two more fire-type Radiant Jade True Qi in his body, and after stepping on Xiao Ran a few times to relieve his anger, he left with a mad face, so arrogant that he didn’t care about the other party’s reaction at all.“Where to go next? I didn’t have enough fun at noon, so I just went to other venues in the afternoon to find some women to play with.”Xia Rongze quickly forgot what had just happened, and started thinking about how to play and abuse women again.Xiao Ran stood in the distance behind him, looked at his back, and let out a cold laugh.Like to play with women, right?Then go, and then you will know what a surprise is.Dare to provoke me, Xiao Ran, I will let you never lift it!Xia Rongze didn’t know his future destiny at all, and set off towards a certain field under Murong Hongxue.On the other hand, Xiao Ran changed his direction and walked outside the pedestrian street.Although Xia Rongze was punished secretly, his mood was not much better.As for why not report the recovery in this way?He was already impotent, does he need Xiao Ran to take revenge in this way?Only……Well!Why does God keep making him meet Xueqi and Su Mingyuan’s date so coincidentally?It caused him to lose Nick last time, and this time he suffered another humiliation.Xiao Ran sighed in his heart.He probably didn’t know that it was his great luck at work, and he wanted him to catch the adulterer on the spot and see through Xia Xueqi’s tricks.It was a pity that he had already been completely deceived by the bad woman Xia Xueqi. Every time he encountered such an occasion, in addition to feeling sad and moved for Xia Xueqi, it was endless discomfort and humiliation for him, and he just wanted to leave early.But soon, his luck came into play again.Just after walking out of the pedestrian street, an old lady who seemed to be in good spirits suddenly fell to the ground clutching her heart, looking uncomfortable and painful, maybe it was a heart attack or something.Although the onlookers were very sympathetic, except for someone who called an emergency number, no one dared to go up to help.The best golden rescue time for a heart attack was 4 to 6 minutes. If the patient couldn’t be rescued within 4 minutes, the patient was likely to enter the stage of biological death, and the hope of survival was extremely slim.If the old lady happened to have a heart attack, before the ambulance came, she would probably have…Originally, Xiao Ran was usually too lazy to take care of this kind of situation, but at this moment, the feeling of happiness reappeared in his mind.He had an inexplicable hunch that saving the old lady would be of great benefit to him!At this moment, a passing young man turned his head and saw this scene, and his face changed greatly, “This old lady’s symptoms look like she has a heart attack, please let me!”He seemed to see the urgency of the matter and wanted to step forward to help the innocent old man.Xiao Ran immediately pushed aside the crowd and shouted, “I know how to help people with heart disease, let me come!”After he finished speaking, he rushed up, pushed the young man aside, and began to give first aid to the old lady.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe young people were still a little surprised.No matter how they saved people these days, people rushed up to grab them, but it was a matter of human life. Now was not the time to fight for it.He had to silently walk aside, hoping that Xiao Ran could rescue the old lady.At this time, Xiao Ran didn’t know that this old lady was the bodyguard next to Su Mingyuan, Li Cheng’s mother.He didn’t know that there was a camera in the dark that had already recorded the cause and effect of this incident from beginning to end.
