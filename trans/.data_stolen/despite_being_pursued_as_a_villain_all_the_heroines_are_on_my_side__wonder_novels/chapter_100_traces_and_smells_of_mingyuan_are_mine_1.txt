“Did I come at a bad time and disturb you?”Xia Xueqi’s voice was cold and angry, instantly awakening Murong Hongxue from her intoxicated appearance.Seeing the person coming, she smiled lightly and said, “No, you came at the right time, Xueqi.”Because if Xia Xueqi came earlier, she and Mingyuan might not be able to do that.And if she came a little later, she wouldn’t be able to see the aftermath.So, now this time was just right.“But I have to trouble Xueqi to wait for a while. Just now Mingyuan didn’t care too much, and soiled my skirt, so I have to change clothes before I could see the guests. Really, I’m so careless. Next time, I must teach him a lesson.”Murong Hongxue pursed her lips and looked like a little woman who was complaining and dissatisfied, but everyone could see how happy she was now.She was not complaining, she was clearly showing off.She went into the back room to change clothes, leaving Xia Xueqi, whose face became increasingly ugly, standing alone at the door.The ice cold face was even more pale, and there was no trace of blood to be seen. The five slender jade-like fingers were clenched together to form a fist.She finally got rid of the disgusting Xiao Ran, but as soon as she came here, she saw a scene that made her even more uncomfortable.But Murong Hongxue still wanted to anger her with words, which made her anger rise to a different level.But she couldn’t be angry yet.Because she was here to find Murong Hongxue for help, she was in a slightly weaker position.Moreover, Murong Hongxue was not the enemy, but her good sister.And Liu Mengning…That chaotic and reckless woman… Whether she was an insignificant pebble or a deadly threatening obstacle was hard to define.So when she had a conference call with Su Xuelan, she shelved her for the last time.But the next one was going to be against her…For a time, Xia Xueqi was tormented by the sudden surge of all kinds of thoughts, and she felt that it was too difficult for her.It was necessary to stabilise Xiao Ran, gain his trust without letting him take advantage of her. On the other hand, when she was still thinking about playing steadily, Murong Hongxue had already started to sneak into the last phase.Did they know that the good feelings they get in this way were all false and fragile, and this was a shortcut that would have difficulty to get a successful result, and it would not work!You are just greedy for a moment of pleasure, but you can’t really take away Mingyuan’s heart.Because you are evil!I am Mingyuan’s fiance, and my steady and slow strategy is the kingly way to a happy ending!I……I will be the one who has the last laugh!“Xueqi, what’s wrong with you, your body is shaking so badly, what’s wrong with you?”Murong Hongxue, who had changed her clothes, was looking at her with a smile and asked with concern.Xia Xueqi glared at her fiercely, trying to calm her inner anger.Who is it that makes me uncomfortable, aren’t you knowingly asking?Murong Hongxue’s eyes wandered, as if she had discovered a new continent, she looked at the corner of her skirt and said in surprise, “Hey, Xueqi, why is your skirt torn? Which little cat with no eyes scratched it for you? But I don’t have pets here either…”She held her chin, looked at Xia Xueqi with a serious look and said, “No way… Xueqi, you were angry and scratched it yourself? Well, probably not, because I have hardly seen you angry. what it looks like.”Xia Xueqi lowered her head only to realize that a fragment of a skirt was lying in her fist that had just clenched the corner of her clothes.Just now, she was so angry that she ripped off her skirt without realising it, giving Murong Hongxue another chance to be mad at her.“My skirt is torn. Do you have any extra clothes? Lend me one to change.”She tried her best to remain restrained and calm, and looked at Murong Hongxue coldly.Murong Hongxue pointed to the back room, but she didn’t irritate her any more. She just let her go in and pick out a random piece of clothes to put on.After all, she was the stinking kitten, it was enough to stimulate her, and there was no need to overdo it.Murong Hongxue thought so.Because……She had the highest qualifications and was only worthy of being Mingyuan’s lover.For these women who had the opportunity to be the main wife, of course she had a little discomfort in her heart, and she would definitely not help stab them if she had the opportunity.But that was about it.Let them fight, don’t really lead the war on yourself, lest she wouldn’t be able to become Mingyuan’s underground lover, that’s the real gain.This was Murong Hongxue’s plan.Back room.Xia Xueqi opened the closet and looked at the long row of luxurious dresses to choose from, but her eyes unconsciously moved to the clothes basket where the dirty clothes were placed.There was the skirt that Murong Hongxue had just changed, and the skirt that was stained with traces of Mingyuan.She couldn’t help but walk over, got closer, and smelled a strange smell that she had never smelled before.At this moment, she suddenly had an inexplicable urge to simply put on this dress and go out to negotiate with Murong Hongxue.#Pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBut she finally stopped the crazy thought in her mind.But……Murong Hongxue, what do you mean by putting these clothes with traces and smells of Mingyuan here and not letting others wash them?Did you just put them her to wait and come back to it later, maybe you even have other ideas?Do you think I’ll let you succeed?True energy condensed on her fingertips as she picked up the dress from the clothes basket, and used her fingers as scissors to cut out all the areas with traces and smells.Murong Hongxue, let you mock me just now.I took this thing away!Only then did she feel a little better, and she chose a dress from the closet and put it on, and when she walked in front of Murong Hongxue, she deliberately raised the lace collar on her chest and said, “Hongxue, although your skirt looks good and fits my body shape very well, but it’s a little tight here…”
