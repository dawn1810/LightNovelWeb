Today’s Xia Xueqi was extraordinarily beautiful.The plain white and exquisite long dress complimented her beauty and coldness, and the silver necklace and diamond earrings reflected the sunlight, making her look sparkling and charming.“It’s a coincidence that we arrived at the same time.”Seeing that Xia Xueqi just got off the bus, Su Mingyuan said with a smile.Xia Xueqi’s face was still so clear and cold, and her eyes were calm and deep, as if his words could not cheer her a little bit.“Come on, let’s go in.”Just when Su Mingyuan lifted his feet to enter the main entrance of the restaurant, Xia Xueqi suddenly stopped him.“Wait, are you going in like this?”“Otherwise?” Su Mingyuan turned his head and asked her back.Xia Xueqi walked towards him, stretched out her slender hand with a bit of disgust in her expression, and said, “As your fiancée, Mingyuan, shouldn’t you be gentlemanly holding my hand and go in together?”She called out Mingyuan, but there was no gentleness in her tone and expression. Su Mingyuan understood that slightly disgusted face.Xia Xueqi wanted him to cooperate with her, act in front of everyone, and act like they were very close.I will satisfy you.But since you spoke to me with such a disgusting look, don’t blame me for doing something to you after grabbing your hand!So Su Mingyuan showed a very gentleman’s smile and stretched out his hand towards Xia Xueqi, “I wonder if I can have the honour to hold this beautiful lady’s hand and enter the restaurant with her for dinner?”Only then did Xia Xueqi gracefully put her slender hand in his palm, and did not forget to remind him deliberately, “Don’t think too much, we are acting!”Yes, yes, we are acting.Then wait, no matter what happens, Xueqi, you shouldn’t blame me. After all, it’s normal for a play to have several accidents during the shooting.The corners of Su Mingyuan’s mouth rose slightly, and he had already thought about how to play tricks on her.It wasn’t that he was upset with Xia Xueqi. After taking away her first kiss on the last date, he was no longer angry with her.Only……Since this time was a date agreed upon by both parties after negotiating the terms with each other, she had at least show him a good face?How dare you look at me with such disgusting eyes?Hmph, I will bully you later and let you see the reality, you really don’t know how many eyes Ma Wangye has!TLN: In the myths and legends of China, there is a Ma Wangye. Legend has it that “Ma Wang has three eyes”, and the statue of Ma Wangye really has three eyes.Thinking of what might happen later, Su Mingyuan was full of expectations.He just wanted to see Xia Xueqi’s face full of disgust in his heart, but on the surface he had to cooperate with her.And just when he took Xia Xueqi’s hand and walked towards the main entrance of the restaurant.“Boss, boss! Look, isn’t that eldest Miss of the Xia family in which you are interested? No, they happen to have a date at this restaurant?”Nick opened his mouth in surprise.Hearing this, Xiao Ran, who was upset, immediately looked out the window.Then when he looked up, he saw Xia Xueqi reaching out and putting her arms in Su Mingyuan’s palm.Laugh!At this moment, as if a sharp arrow pierced his heart.He clenched his fists all of a sudden, and his eyes instantly turned slightly red.He never imagined that he would be oppressed by Murong Hongxue, and in a blink of an eye, he saw the woman he liked dressed up so beautifully and was dating his enemy.She also took the initiative to put her slender hand into his palm!They even walked into the restaurant holding hands!And Xueqi’s hand, but even I have not yet held it! I was actually sacked by the waste of Su Mingyuan…Ah! Ah! Ah!At this moment, Xiao Ran really wanted to roar up to the heavens, and wanted to rush down angrily to separate the two, and then use all his strength to slap this straw bag that dared to defile Xueqi into pieces!But he couldn’t!He couldn’t do this!Because he remembered the phone call with Xueqi before, her date with Su Mingyuan was entirely caused by him!And when he thought of the disgusted expression on Xueqi’s face when she reached out to Su Mingyuan just now, he could imagine how disgusted and uncomfortable she was in her heart at that time!But she had to endure this emotion and took the initiative to hold Su Mingyuan’s hand!And all of this qas because of his faults, his mistakes, and his arrogance that created the current consequences!Ah! Ah! Ah!Why… why do you want me to see such a scene with my own eyes?Why… why did I appear at the scene of their date at this time!Xiao Ran’s heart was extremely tormented, extremely painful, and he was almost going crazy in anger.At this moment, seeing this scene, the request that Murong Hongxue made to him came to mind again: In the next public meeting with Su Mingyuan, bow your head and apologise to him.Is it here?At this restaurant where the two of them dated?In front of so many people?In front of Xueqi?He had to bow his head to apologise to Su Mingyuan?Boom!Xiao Ran punched a hole in the seat under him.He turned his face away, daring not to look at the scene over there, and clasped his forehead with both hands. After all, he couldn’t restrain his emotions, and let out a low roar, “Ahhhhh!!!”At this moment, his mentality completely collapsed.“Boss, boss, are you okay?” Nick asked with concern when he saw his appearance.After Xiao Ran groaned, he instantly became depressed, like an old general who was defeated on the battlefield. Whether it was his eyes or his movements, he seemed so sad at the moment.“Nick, let’s… let’s go and eat at another restaurant.”When he said these words in a slump, his spirit and momentum completely collapsed, like a defeated rooster slumped on the seat, daring not to look there again.#pleasereadthisatwondernovels.comWhat else could he do?This was the consequence of his own mistakes, and he had long known from Xueqi that she would date Su Mingyuan, otherwise her situation in the family would become more difficult.And now that he had opened a security company, he couldn’t tell anyone to help her, lest he might even trigger a more violent backlash from the Su Xia family.What could he do?He couldn’t do anything.He could only watch.No, at least…He could also choose to escape.He didn’t have to endure great pain, helplessness, remorse and anger, to see the woman he liked with his own eyes dating that trashy bum Su Mingyuan!Anyway, he believed that Xueqi would not do anything wrong to him, and he also knew that Su Mingyuan was a sterile…“Boss, shall we just leave like this? What if Su Mingyuan’s bastard does something wrong with Miss Xia?” Nick said worriedly at this time.He didn’t know about Su Mingyuan’s physical condition, and Xiao Ran wouldn’t tell anyone this secret casually.But……Nick also made sense.Being sterile didn’t mean that Su Mingyuan couldn’t do other things. Xueqi was only a weak woman after all. If Su Mingyuan wanted to bully her or even beat her, she couldn’t resist and could only bear it.However, I want him to stay here calmly and watch Xueqi and Su Mingyuan go on a date with that scumbag…Nick seemed to have seen something, and said with discernment, “Boss, why don’t you…you go back first? I’ll stay to spy on Su Mingyuan, protect Miss Xia, and never let her suffer any harm or grievance!”#pleasereadthisatwondernovels.comXiao Ran was silent for a while, then nodded, “Nick, then… please.”So, Xiao Ran drove away.Nick got out of the car, walked to the small lake outside the restaurant, hid behind a willow tree, and carefully observed and monitored the movement inside.And in this scene, Su Xuelan, who was just a step late, was able to see the whole situation.***
