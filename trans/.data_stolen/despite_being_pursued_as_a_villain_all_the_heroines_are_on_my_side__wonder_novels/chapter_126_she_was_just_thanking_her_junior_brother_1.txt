If Xiao Ran had chosen to stand up instead of watching the play when Su Mingyuan was in conflict with Xia Rongze just now,  Su Mingyuan would have tolerated his behaviour.However, your father, I have done everything, and you still want to come out to pick fruit?If this was in the last episode, Su Mingyuan might feel that it didn’t matter, or even take it for granted.After all, Xiao Ran was the protagonist of this world.Shouldn’t he meet these female protagonists, have different interactions and misunderstandings with them, and then end up liking them?However, this week, his mentality had changed unconsciously.Now he thought that he shouldn’t try so hard to help this useless son chase women and make up for the plot, and even if he does help him catch up, there might be many more changes in the future, and he still needed to go to great lengths to fix it.In that case, it would be better for him to do it myself. He would do it himself, and hold them in his hands.When the time comes, I have the last say in how the plot develops, isn’t that right?You are an indisputable thing. Just obediently follow the arrangements that I, your father,  secretly made. Take the road you should take. Don’t interfere with I, you father, when doing serious things, get it?Of course, Su Mingyuan couldn’t tear his true face with Xiao Ran here.His current identity was Xiao Ran’s false junior brother, and now he had won his trust. In the future, he would need to use this identity to make Xiao Ran listen to him obediently and follow the novel script.So although he was slightly annoyed, he just looked back at him with a look of surprise, and said in exclaimed,“Senior brother, what a coincidence, did you… just got here?”Just got here?If he had just arrived, how could Xiao Ran have known exactly what had just happened here?Xiao Ran’s face suddenly turned red, feeling a little sorry for his junior brother.He had a chance to stand up and face Xia Rongze with his junior brother just now, but he chose to watch the play in the dark.And when Liu Mengning took off her sunglasses, revealing her beautiful and stunning face, he felt an uncontrollable urge in his heart, so he couldn’t help but come out. Trying to overshadow his junior brother, he wanted to show himself in front of her.It reminds me of the first time…… I met Xia Xueqi.Actually, if Su Xuelan and Murong Hongxue hadn’t been hostile to him when they first appeared, he would most likely have the same heartbeat for them.He, the world’s preordained protagonist, had an instinctive desire to possess and conquer these heroines who should have belonged to him.In short, not only did he choose to watch the play just now, but he also thought that junior brother was so good, so he dared not anger the young master of the Xia family for the sake of a woman he didn’t know.As a result, when he saw Liu Mengning’s true face in the next second, his heart couldn’t stop racing.What’s wrong with me?Facing Su Mingyuan’s strange eyes, even Xiao Ran, who had never been a good person, couldn’t help feeling a trace of shame at this moment.Junior brother is so selfless and kind to me, how can I suddenly become hot-headed and do such a disdainful thing?He felt a little ashamed, but he still followed the throbbing in his heart and walked towards Liu Mengning for some reason.As Xiao Ran approached, he could feel Liu Mengning’s soul-stirring beauty that was well-liked by people of all age.Xiao Ran couldn’t help but be obsessed with such beautyHe was stunned for a moment, then came back to his senses, and the corner of his mouth curved up, revealing a smile that he felt was very polite and friendly.“Hello, beautiful lady. Nice to meet you. My name is Xiao Ran.”Liu Mengning, as if she hadn’t seen him, skipped him straight over and walked towards Su Mingyuan.“This kind gentleman, I just asked your name, you haven’t answered me yet?”When facing Xiao Ran walking towards her, Liu Mengning’s expression was cold and indifferent.But, when she walked in front of Su Mingyuan, her smile suddenly seemed as bright as spring.An inexplicable unhappiness suddenly lingered in Xiao Ran’s heart.He approached Liu Mengning and respectfully introduced himself, wanting to become his friend.But, she didn’t bother to pay attention to him.She didn’t care who he was or what his name was; she just wanted to know the name of his junior brother.Her attitude towards him was so indifferent and disregarding, but her treatment towards his junior brother was like a spring breeze!Negative thoughts such as jealousy and hatred sprang from the depths of his heart and began to spread and grow.Xiao Ran was a little annoyed.Never before had a woman ignored him like this!Even with it, there was some dissatisfaction with Su Mingyuan in his heart.But then, when he realised this, he suddenly felt even greater shame and guilt in his heart.This junior brother clearly did nothing wrong; what I did was somewhat unreasonable, I have no right to be angry with him!Especially, when he heard Su Mingyuan next to me say this:“You can call me a knight or whatever you want. Also, next to me is my senior brother Xiao Ran. He just took the initiative to greet you, but you didn’t give him the slightest response. Isn’t this a bit impolite?”Junior Brother!My junior brother!When he heard Su Mingyuan’s words, Xiao Ran’s heart was guilty and ecstatic again!And when Liu Mengning listened to Su Mingyuan’s words, she turned around and smiled faintly at him, “Hello, my name is Liu Mengning, and I am glad to meet you.”Xiao Ran’s heart had already flown into the sky with excitement.He also didn’t know why he had only met Liu Mengning for the first time and fell in love with her.He didn’t know why, but her tone of voice became slightly gentler. Just a shallow smile made him dazzled, and he was intoxicated to the point that he couldn’t help himself, as if he was possessed by evil spirits.Just as at the end of the second performance, Xia Xueqi called him to the office and smiled at him faintly, and he immediately became extremely emotional, his soul flew to the sky, and his entire being was captivated by her charm.#pleasreadthischapteratwondernovels.comLiu Mengning just smiled at him perfunctorily, but this point was inexplicably filtered by his heart, causing him to have an inexplicable illusion.Now, a sentence echoed repeatedly in his mind:She smiled at me!Liu Mengning!She smiled at me!However, he didn’t notice that after Liu Mengning introduced herself perfunctorily, she turned around and ignored him, looking at Su Mingyuan tenderly with a genuine smile.He was already intoxicated by such a smile and indulged in that inexplicable illusion.What he didn’t know was that his performance from beginning to end was completely looked at and remembered by the two  old men hiding in the woods.The impression score that was not very high in the minds of these two people suddenly fell sharply.The old man of the Liu family immediately snorted coldly, and said to the old man of the Ye family, “Oldman Ye, I think it’s better not to let Xiao Ran play chess with us from now on? Look at him, he looks like a virtuous person, and I thought we had finally met a chess player who did not admire dignitaries’ character, but now it seems…? he…”He would curse him if it weren’t for their gentlemanly demeanour.Seeing Xiao Ran’s pig-like appearance in front of his granddaughter, he wondered why he was so blind before.“Okay okay, Oldman Ye, don’t worry. You can still play this chess game with him in the future. After all, it’s rare for me to meet such an opponent on the chessboard, but we will only play chess with him in the future. This friendship, just stop here.”—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
