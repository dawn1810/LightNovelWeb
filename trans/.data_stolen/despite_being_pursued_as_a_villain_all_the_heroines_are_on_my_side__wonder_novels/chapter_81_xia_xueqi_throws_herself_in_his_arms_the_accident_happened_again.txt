I’m doing a good job this time around, I’m doing a great job!Su Mingyuan couldn’t help but praise himself in his heart.Look at my acting skills, this movement, this expression, this fast speech speed that I want to regain 10% of the time after being stabbed in a sore spot.Doesn’t this fit perfectly with what Xia Xueqi just said about her guilty conscience?Look, Xia Xueqi was fooled by this, brought up a charming smile that seemed to have everything under her control, and spoke to me as if she wanted me to bow down.Yes, you can smile, you can smile.If you stick closer, it’s better to kiss. I, Su Mingyuan, don’t mind at all.He stared angrily, looking unconvinced.But Xia Xueqi, like a tolerant mother who treated a rebellious child, gently held up his face, her heavy plumpness was only a palm away from Su Mingyuan’s hand that had nowhere to rest. As she was slightly bent, her chest made a tempting curve, agitating him, making him unable to control his expression.She said softly:“Look at Mingyuan, you’re in a hurry again, I just told you not to act like this when you’re guilty, but you don’t seem to have listened.“Or……”Her tone was elongated, and her delicate and smooth palms rubbed Su Mingyuan’s face, as if she was playing with rare treasures.“Because I told your inner secret, you’ve panicked to the point where you can’t hide it?”She seemed to have completely grasped him as something in her palm.“Mingyuan, to be honest, when I deduced this conjecture, I felt it a little unbelievable at first, but your nervous and panic reaction helped me thoroughly confirm the correctness of this conjecture.“You, after acting for so many years, you should be more prudent, calmer at this time, don’t be so stabbed in the weakness that you can’t help but jump.”“But do you know, when I learned that your ugly and dreadful image in the past was all performed. When I learned that you have been bearing humiliation and burdens all these years. Your evaluation in my heart suddenly got a super~big improvement. The disgust and rejection of you, all of a sudden dissipated.”“Even if I come into contact with your skin like now, I don’t seem to be that repulsive anymore.”“Xia Xueqi! I don’t have any interest in improving your evaluation at all, and now you just discovered my secret and felt that you could use this to control me, so you don’t exclude skin contact with me.“Don’t put on a gentle face here and think that giving me a little beauty favour will make me thank god for being your dog! I’ll tell you again, you’re just daydreaming!”Su Mingyuan was possessed by the Film Emperor, raised his neck and roared in a low voice, with a mighty and unyielding look. He was actually roaring with happiness inside.Ah, yes, yes, Xia Xueqi, you are right, I, Su Mingyuan, are now the little treasure you are holding, and I am the prey in your hands.You thought you were a hunter, didn’t you?If you want to give me the grace of beauty, how can only so little skin-to-skin contact be enough?Being so close, do you dare to take the initiative to kiss like last time?Do you dare to take the initiative to let me knead and knead your… ah?Such a huge sin, if you don’t let me seize it and ravage it, I won’t be obediently held by you and listen to your threats!Of course, these were just subconscious thoughts in Su Mingyuan’s mind. After all, it was impossible to happen.How could there be such an accident as last time, making him appreciate Xia Xueqi’s charming and shy face in turn?“Mingyuan, you are really a stubborn and unruly child. However, after discovering your true face, now that you look like this in my eyes, not only does it not make me feel disgusted, but it is full of cuteness.”Xia Xueqi said with a light smile, her head dropped slightly, so close that she met Su Mingyuan’s eyes. Her lips were less than two centimetres apart, and the scorching, sweet breath that she exhaled softly almost fascinated him.This damn bad woman thought she was in a position to win, so she was teasing him here.Then, a sense of loss unconsciously found its way inside Su Mingyuan’s heart. The bad woman raised her head again, the distance between her lips quickly pulled away, and the slender hands stroking his cheek all the way down.“Mingyuan, didn’t you think I really wanted to kiss you just now?”The tenderness in her eyes, the smile at the corner of her mouth, and her soft voice suddenly turned into a snowstorm at this moment, which made Su Mingyuan instantly feel dumbfounded.While sorting out Su Mingyuan’s scattered collars, she sneered and said, “Next time this happens, remember not to show such a big reaction in front of others. Only I can know your secret, understand!”She tightened his neckline, and a cold and domineering aura came over her face.This was the true face of this bad woman, the tenderness just now, those soft skin-to-skin touches, those gentle murmurs, those actions, those provocations were all fake!When she knew Su Mingyuan’s secret and completely controlled him, she no longer had to pretend.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe aura of the Iceberg Queen was back on her!Su Mingyuan seemed to be really shocked, nodded and said, “Ming… I understand.”“Heh, that’s what I want to hear from you.”Xia Xueqi smiled coldly, pressed his collar flat, and got up to leave.She seemed to think confidently that she had complete control over him.However, just as she straightened up and was about to turn around and take a step, an accident happened.It was a puddle of water.A puddle of water that had been premeditatedly spilled on the ground.That was the water spilled by the waiter who accidentally didn’t hold the tray firmly.Some of them spilled on Su Mingyuan, and Su Mingyuan wiped it off with a tissue.But more were spilled on the ground, and no one came to wipe it.And when Xia Xueqi just came over from the opposite side, she just happened to be standing on this pool of water.At this time, she exerted a little force on her little feet, and was still preparing to take a step with the strength she was familiar with in the past, but the friction coefficient changed because of the water on the ground.The crisp high heels did not sound. Not only did she not have time to turn around and take a step, she slid with her feet, and with a small exclamation of “ah”, her body that had just straightened up suddenly fell uncontrollably towards Su Mingyuan.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comTwo seconds ago, her lips were less than two centimetres close to Su Mingyuan’s.Her proud and tall plump was only a palm away from Su Mingyuan’s palm.She just straightened up with this posture, and at this moment she fell into Su Mingyuan’s arms with the same trajectory.Then.Her lips fell on Su Mingyuan’s lips.The softness that he couldn’t hold in one hand was just caught by Su Mingyuan in the palm of his hand.Her charming and soft body fell into Su Mingyuan’s arms.She was stunned.Su Mingyuan was also stunned.Then–Su Mingyuan blinked at her and moved gently…Pinch.***
