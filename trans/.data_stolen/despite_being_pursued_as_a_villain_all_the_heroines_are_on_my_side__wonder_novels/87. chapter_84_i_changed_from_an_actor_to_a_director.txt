I changed from an actor to a director?Xiao Ran’s mentality was really about to collapse.Yes, although he knew Su Mingyuan’s secret, he knew that Ruoruo and Su Mingyuan had made a verbal agreement, but who knew if Su Mingyuan would do something to Ruoruo when he got angry?Terrible associations began to appear uncontrollably in his  mind.Xiao Ran only felt that his head was aching, and his heart was also beating first. He lost his subordinates and Xueqi’s goodwill. Ruoruo might still encounter a poisonous hand…Hearing Xiao Ran’s panicked voice on the other end of the phone, Xia Xueqi couldn’t help showing a sneer, and started to make up on the spot, “That night, you insulted Su Mingyuan’s face. After he returned to the villa, he immediately made your sister Xiao Ruoruo go hungry without food for a whole day, and asked her to clean the whole villa from the inside to the outside by herself. When will it be cleaned? Well, when will she have dinner?”“Tsk tsk, did you know that she was going to be hungry again, enduring the weakness of dizziness and weakness, and the pain of cleaning the villa alone?”Su Mingyuan’s punishment for Ruoruo turned out to be to punish her for cleaning up when she was hungry, but the things I imagined didn’t happen…call–For some reason, Xiao Ran’s heart was relieved after hearing these words.But then, he was ashamed of himself for having such an idea, for his brief relaxation, and wanted to slap himself.If Ruoruo suffered there, but Su Mingyuan didn’t take advantage of it, I wouldn’t feel very sad in my heart. On the contrary, I felt relieved?What the hell am I thinking!That’s my sister, how can I think like that!But in fact, after hearing this news, his mentality that he was about to collapse was pulled back a lot at once.“Xiao Ran, this time your approach is really out of bounds.”“I… I know, Xue Qi, forgive me, I promise there will be no next time.” Xiao Ran’s voice didn’t have a hint of toughness at this moment, it sounded like a pleading.The dignified king of killers would actually lower his attitude when facing the woman he loved and ask her for forgiveness.The air seemed to freeze at this moment.Xia Xueqi didn’t answer immediately, but seemed to be lost in thought.This unspeakable silence made Xiao Ran feel anxious.He was waiting for Xia Xueqi’s understanding, and he hoped to hear the answer he wanted from her.He finally got some progress from Murong Hongxue, but now he had completely offended the Su Xia family because of Nick’s self-assertion…At this moment, apart from her, no one seemed to be able to comfort him, and no one could help him.Maybe the mysterious junior brother would have a solution, but he just didn’t know how to contact him.For a long time.Xia Xueqi’s voice finally rang on the other end of the phone. Although it was still cold and flat, it sounded like the sound of nature to him.“Xiao Ran, I… will try to help you in private to try to minimise this matter, but don’t hide it from me when you want to do something in the future, and discuss it with me first, okay?”“Xueqi, thank you, thank you!”On the other end of the phone, Xiao Ran was moved to tears.He knew that she was cold-hearted and warm-hearted, and she was kind and moving.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comEven though his actions hurt Xuewi, she still chose to forgive him and help him.What a wonderful woman she is!How fortunate he was to be able to fall in love with such a girl!After hanging up the phone, Xia Xueqi sneered as she watched Xiao Ran’s name dim on the screen with a contemptuous expression on her face.She didn’t feel as uncomfortable and disgusting as she used to call Xiao Ran this time, because today she had already received enough energy from Mingyuan in advance.“Have you thought about how to reply to the punishment of the Su Xia family?” Su Xuelan asked with a smile at this time.“I will tell him that although Xia Chengquan and I have worked hard in secret, if he wants to temporarily get the forgiveness of the Su family, then he needs to do at least one thing.”“That’s the next public occasion to meet Mingyuan…”“Publicly apologise to Mingyuan and admit his mistakes, right?” Before Xia Xueqi finished speaking, Su Xuelan continued the second half of her sentence.Xia Xueqi looked at her, she also looked at Xia Xueqi, and the two smiled at each other.They were indeed good sisters who knew each other very well, and made the same decision as Murong Hongxue at this moment.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAs for the forgiveness of the Su Xia family mentioned on the phone?Xiao Ran’s actions this time had not been known by the Su Xia family at all, so how did the two families get angry?The Su Family here was clearly referring to Su Xuelan and Xia Xueqi.It was a pity that Xiao Ran didn’t know this, and that now and in the future, he would still be kept in the dark.………………When Rolls-Royce returned to the villa, Su Mingyuan walked into the door.He always felt that this scene seemed familiar.The last time he had a date with Xia Xueqi almost had the same view.He took advantage and ran away, but he didn’t even have lunch when he got home…But this time, he knew that even if the lovely and caring Ruoruo knew that he was out on a date, she would definitely leave lunch for him.Opening the restaurant door, he saw Ruoruo looking out the window, her small mouth pouting softly, and her two small feet swaying in unhappiness, looking lonely, weak, and pitiful.But as soon as she heard the sound of the door opening and saw Su Mingyuan appear, a bright smile appeared on her poor little face, making the sunlight sprinkled from the transparent veil bright and shining.“Brother Mingyuan, I knew you wouldn’t lie to me. I’m sure you’ll come back!”She trotted to Su Mingyuan. Her eyes were filled with emotion and were as glistening as stars.Su Mingyuan smiled, ran his fingers through her hair, and said,  “Last time I temporarily arrested and taken home by my sister, this time I promised you to return early, I will definitely return early.”No way! If I run from that situation right now, I fear I will be the one to suffer!Obviously, he won’t say it from the bottom of his heart. Now, he still points to Ruoruo’s favor in order to take her for his own use, so as to cooperate with his own acting in the future.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comOh, right! There is also Xia Xueqi.Now that she has found my “true face,” her hatred for me has decreased greatly and it seems a little difficult to use her hatred for me  to push the plot forward.Do I really want to proceed with the second plan, find a method to make her fall madly in love with me, and have everyone obey my orders except for Ruoruo?Hiss——！I feel like I’m not just a fucking actor playing a villain now, but I have to worry about the fucking director’s job too!
