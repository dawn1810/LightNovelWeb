[Little brother, there is a new movie that looks good recently. I want to watch it with you~]Still want to invite my Mingyuan to a movie?At that time, when the lights would be dim, wouldn’t it just be convenient for you to do something?Xia Xueqi immediately sent a voice over,“I didn’t pursue it after you were kicked out by me last time. Do you think I’m easy to talk to and bully? You even have the guts to contact my fiancé in private!”“Remember Murong Hongxue, do you want to experience the feeling of being targeted by her? Next time you dare to contact Mingyuan in private, I will directly ask Murong Hongxue to come to you with a knife!”Xia Xueqi directly issued a severe warning threat.It was impossible for a woman like this to be in the circle to not know Murong Hongxue’s cruelty and ruthlessness, and it was impossible not to be afraid of Murong Hongxue’s reputation.This woman’s name was much more effective than others in certain threatening situations and times.Lingxue Pavilion.After Murong Hongxue had a meal with Su Mingyuan yesterday, she already knew his taste and wanted more.Although it had only been one night, she already felt that like a year had passed, and she wanted to see him again, and wanted to do more intimate things with him.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comSince Mingyuan can turn into a white knight and have a fight with me, Murong Hongxue, why can’t I put on makeup and put on a mask to have a romantic affair with Mingyuan in another identity?However, after the news was sent, the reply she received made Murong Hongxue’s anxious and anticipating mood completely plunge into the abyss.“Xia Xueqi! It’s you again!”Murong Hongxue’s heart burst into flames, and she couldn’t control her emotions and crushed her phone.What’s even more irritating is that this woman’s arrogant and threatening tone doesn’t matter, the most important thing is that she also uses my name to threaten me!And Murong Hongxue even tried to calm down now, but apart from taking a deep breath while looking at the word “quiet” left by Su Mingyuan, she could only go to the desk, pick up a pen and ink, and vent her emotions by crazy calligraphy and writing.Because Xia Xueqi, a bad woman who had done all her evil deeds, secretly cut the dress with Mingyuan marks and smells when she changed her clothes yesterday!Murong Hongxue kept writing the word “quiet” on the rice paper.But later, the word “quiet” was silently twisted into the word “kill” between strokes and strokes.This time, Xiao Ran’s men couldn’t be killed to vent her anger. He had not many people in his hands, and he had to use it to maintain his newly opened security company and film and television company.And these two companies had already been considered by Murong Hongxue and Xia Xueqi as their own.That being the case…Murong Hongxue suddenly thought of a candidate.Xia Xueqi’s younger brother Xia Rongze.Doesn’t he like to go to the venues under his hands to find women to play with? And every time he was unusually rude, causing the girls under his hands to complain again and again.Next time he comes, I will get him a man.………………After sending the voice message to the other party, Xia Xueqi saw that the other party did not reply, she was probably frightened by her threat, so she smiled coldly, quickly deleted the chat history, and put Su Mingyuan’s phone back in place, pretending like it never happened.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThen looking at the empty wine glass on the table, she silently filled it with wine.Originally, she had arranged some manpower here, but when she discovered Su Mingyuan’s trick to persuade her to get drunk, she suddenly felt that all the arrangements today might not come in handy.She just needed to cooperate with him and quietly wait for the surprise he prepared for her.When Su Mingyuan walked out of the bathroom, he happened to bump into a man in a flamboyant pink suit.“Hey, Brother Su, are you eating here too?”The boy spoke with a familiar look.Su Mingyuan took a closer look,isn’t this just another dude among the four big dudes in Ming City, the direct son of the Xia family, the younger brother of Xia Xueqi, Xia Rongze, who likes to play with women?“Oh, I didn’t expect to meet you here by chance.” Su Mingyuan’s tone was light, and he didn’t have much interest in chatting with him.However, he had no interest in chatting with Xia Rongze, but Xia Rongze had always been yearning for him, the biggest dude in Ming City, and said very proactively, “Brother Su, I have always trusted you with your vision and taste, little brother, but this time I’m having dinner with a beautiful woman. Can you come with me to see, I happened to bring beauty here, why don’t we… go get a table?”Facing Xia Rongze’s evil smirk, Su Mingyuan just glanced at him coldly and said, “With your sister, are you sure you want to join me at a table?”The smile on Xia Rongze’s face froze at this moment, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes, as if thinking of something terrifying.“No… No need, Brother Su, oh no, brother-in-law, I won’t disturb your date with my sister, and you mustn’t tell her that I am here with women.”Xia Rongze shook his head again and again and stepped back, accidentally stepping on a waiter who was passing by, his face changed suddenly, and he spat at the opposite side arrogantly, “Something without eyes, dare to block my way? Didn’t you see me there talking to my brother-in-law?”The waiter didn’t dare to be angry, didn’t dare to say anything, didn’t even dare to wipe the saliva from his face. He just kept bowing his head and apologised.But, he was unhappy and stomped on the waiter a few times before letting him go. When he turned to face Su Mingyuan, he immediately put on a pleasing smile and said, “Also, brother-in-law, when did you marry my sister? I believe that with your brother-in-law’s level of picking up girls, you will definitely be able to win her soon, right? If there is anything that needs my help, as long as I can help, you can take down my sister. You can mention it, even if it is medicine…, I, I can help you…”“Okay, just stay and play by yourself.” Su Mingyuan waved his hand impatiently and left.This Xia Rongze was not a good thing.When he treated other people, whether it was a man or a woman, as long as their status was lower than him, he didn’t treat the other person as a human being.Su Mingyuan felt that he would lose his mind if he talked a few more words with such a person.On the way back to the dining table, Su Mingyuan did not take this unpleasant mood with him.Because when he saw Xia Xueqi leaning against the sofa and lightly rubbing her forehead, the black silk legs and the skirt that were close together outlined a looming absolute field; the ice-white pretty face was stained with a touch of drunkenness.When he saw this beautiful and seductive beauty slightly drunk, any unpleasant mood was instantly thrown into the clouds.He immediately asked the waiter for a bowl of sobering soup, then sat next to Xia Xueqi and hugged her body tightly, while smelling the fragrance on her body and feeling the silky smoothness of her skin, he asked with concern, “Xueqi, are you all right? This red wine may have a lot of power. Even I feel a little dizzy right now. I’ve already asked the waiter for sober soup. Can I feed you later?”What hangover soup, will Su Mingyuan prepare hangover soup at this critical moment?Just a nice hot drink!Xia Xueqi opened her eyes slightly, and under her long eyelashes, the pair of eyes that used to be as cold as the winter night  seemed to have melted with a hint of fascination at this moment because of her drunkenness.She opened her lips slightly, as if she wanted to refuse, but in the end she just gave him a look of anger, her delicate red lips reflected a glittering and seductive lustre under the light, and she snorted softly, “……Um.”Su Mingyuan was stunned at this moment.Whether it was the amorous feelings flowing between her brows and eyes, the intoxicating blush on her snow-white and crystalline skin, or her charming red lips like rose petals, and her soft and tender moan that evoked desire in the heart…So beautiful, so tempting, so seductive!If it weren’t for being drunk, Xia Xueqi would never show such a charming and seductive attitude.She would never accept his approach so easily and agree to feed her sober soup!There was a word called stunned.At this moment, Su Mingyuan’s heart was pounding, blood was rushing excitedly in his blood vessels, and there was an uncontrollable emotion growing in his heart.When he asked Xia Xueqi to take the initiative to lean into his arms, holding her slender waist in one hand, holding the hangover soup in the other, watching the soup flow from her delicate and lovely bright red lips.She drank it, and from time to time there was a faint but incomparably seductive groan leaving her mouth. Occasionally a drop or two of the soup spilled down the smooth and slender neck along the bright red lips.Su Mingyuan almost wanted to lower his head and lick it!Why is this damn bad woman so attractive!Don’t you know that your appearance is simply a great test of xinxing to me?I really almost couldn’t help but would rather deduct the villain points than not eat you!This wave of Su Mingyuan’s thoughts really made Xia Xueqi let go of her defences quietly, revealing a soft and charming attitude that was usually difficult to see, so that he could better conduct strategy.But he almost couldn’t help but break his power because of this seduction.He must hold back!Xia Xueqi only drank a small half of a bowl, but she couldn’t drink any more, so she leaned in his arms and closed her eyes slightly to rest.And Su Mingyuan looked at the remaining half of the bowl of sober soup, and suddenly felt that he was also a little dizzy and needed to sober up.And there was so much left, so it couldn’t be wasted.He picked up the bowl, and whether it was intentional or coincidental, his lips just met where Xia Xueqi’s lips had just touched.Su Mingyuan couldn’t help feeling an illusion while drinking the hangover soup.Why is this sobering soup that Xia Xueqi drank so much better than those drinks, and it also tastes a little sweet…In his arms, Xia Xueqi quietly opened her eyes, watching this scene, the corners of her mouth rose silently by a few tenths of a centimetres.
