After the date was over, they rushed back to their respective homes.The atmosphere was indeed right and their relationship had gone a step further.Su Mingyuan felt that from now on, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to pull Xia Xueqi’s little hand, put his arms around her waist, and occasionally let her kiss him twice.But, if you want to be there in one step directly, it would indeed be a bit whimsical.Of course, Xia Xueqi also had her own restraint. She knew that what someone got too easily would only make people not cherish it.Her relationship with Mingyuan had taken a major step tonight.Next, she only needed to slowly advance the relationship between the two, and she would naturally be able to proceed to the last step. There was no need to hurry.The two of them were very satisfied and a little reluctant to end the date.As soon as Xia Xueqi got home, she saw Xia Rongze, who was covering his private part with a complicated expression.She didn’t bother to care about where he went to fool around. She snorted coldly, walked straight into her room, and slammed the door shut.The only thing that she pitied tonight was that she forgot to take some pictures of the beautiful date for later use.But, it wasn’t bad. Although there were no photos, after Liu Mengning’s existence was automatically eliminated in her mind, the sweetness of every minute and second of this date had been engraved in the deepest part of her heart and would never be forgotten.Xia Xueqi was lying on the bed holding the pillow, imagining that she was holding Su Mingyuan who was staring at her affectionately.“I always feel… I haven’t kissed enough tonight…”Compared with Xia Xueqi, who was intoxicated with aftertastes, Xia Rongze was downright unlucky today.Covering his injured buttocks, he looked at himself in despair and pain. He doubted his life, and said, “Why, why can’t it stand up all of a sudden?”“Why… It was such a humiliating and painful thing, I actually… I actually felt it…”Thinking of the terrifying scene covered in sweat, he clenched his fists in pain and gritted his teeth, but after a while, he slowly loosened it.Because in such a scene of humiliation and despair, he actually felt a trace of happiness, a sense of inexplicable security that he had never felt before…No! What am I thinking!There must be something wrong!No, it’s definitely not my fault, definitely not!Tomorrow!Tomorrow I must take medicine, find a woman to prove myself, and revive the glory of men!Xia Rongze clenched his fists and swore in his heart.…………When he got back to the villa, the lights in the house were still on.Su Mingyuan kept his appointment again, did not spend the night outside, but came back.There was no way he could do that. Although he left a super high impression on Xia Xueqi today, and their relationship had gone further, he had to take it slowly. This was a step-by-step process.In a hurry, if one just want to take the other party to the hotel for the night, which would only make him look frivolous. It would ruin his previous efforts.But.He would go on a few more dates with Xueqi. Each time, if he pushed a little bit, it would come naturally…while Su Mingyuan fantasised about this things, Ruoruo immediately jumped into his arms excitedly after seeing him come back.Although brother Mingyuan’s arms were filled with the smell of sister Xueqi, fortunately he came back, and did not spend the night with sister Xueqi.That’s fine, that’s fine…It’s just that when I think of the two people kissing in a very romantic way under the beautiful fireworks. When I think of brother Mingyuan’s body, and lips being covered with the smell of sister Xueqi…Ruoruo pouted, appearing very unhappy.“Brother Mingyuan, welcome back!”She raised her small face, gave Su Mingyuan a bright smile, and then stood on tiptoe, wanting to kiss him.At least on the lips of brother Mingyuan, there should be my smell.But, Su Mingyuan felt a little embarrassed when he saw Ruoruo’s actions at this time.He had just kissed Xueqi hotly, and all she had left on his lips was her cold and sweet taste, and then he used these lips, which were covered with Xueqi’s smell, to kiss Ruoruo…No matter how you think about it, it was too bad.Maybe he would feel better about it in the future.But, at least now, he couldn’t do such a shameless thing with peace of mind.“That, Ruoruo, I’m a little tired. I want to rest first.”He gently pressed Ruoruo’s shoulder, tilted his head without a trace, and avoided Ruoruo’s attack.Ruoruo was so anxious that she was about to cry,is brother Mingyuan completely hooked by Sister Xueqi?He don’t even want my kiss now!Originally, she still thought that she must attack boldly tonight, and even if brother Mingyuan wanted to, she could put on white silk, use her fragrant and tender feet to help him…Seeing Su Mingyuan walking up to the second floor, Ruoruo was sad, and felt wronged, like an abandoned kitten with her lowered head, she walked listlessly to her room.“That’s right, Ruoruo.”Suddenly, Su Mingyuan walked down the stairs again.He took out a pure white rose from nowhere, and gently placed it between Ruoruo’s ear and hair, and said with a smile, “I saw this flower on the way back, and I suddenly felt that it should look good on your head. Now it seems that it really suits you.”“Brother Mingyuan…”The mood that had just fallen to the bottom of the valley was instantly lifted to the sky, and she seemed to have witnessed the bright and beautiful sunshine after a dark night.Ruoruo’s eyes were slightly red, tears threatening to fall out, and she looked at Su Mingyuan with emotions.She knew that her brother Mingyuan would not forget her!Su Mingyuan fondly touched her hair, then swiped her nose with a smile, and said, “Okay, okay, my dear little secretary, it’s time to go to bed. I don’t want to see a little tabby cat with swollen eyes from crying.”“Um!”Ruoruo pursed her lips tightly and nodded her head very cutely.Although she couldn’t compare to Sister Xueqi, brother Mingyuan didn’t forget her, and even gave her such a romantic and beautiful gift. How could she hide in the room and cry?#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comIf I want to cry, I should cry with joy, right?Only then did Su Mingyuan go upstairs with confidence.Just kidding, with his experience of dealing with many female protagonists in the last week, how could he not notice Ruoruo’s lost mood?He gave her a blow first, and then gave her a surprise reversal.
