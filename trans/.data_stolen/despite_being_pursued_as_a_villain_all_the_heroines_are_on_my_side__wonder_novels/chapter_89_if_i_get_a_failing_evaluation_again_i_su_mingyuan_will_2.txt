But in this way, the position of the lover beside him had already been occupied by Xia Xueqi, and if he wanted other female protagonists to cooperate with his performance in the future, he could only think of other ways.But fortunately, after a long time, Liu Mengning, was the female protagonist who would appear, and the others would appear after more plots.At that time, he would have Ruoruo, sister and Xia Xueqi on his side, and he would get three out of the five female protagonists. With their help, he should be able to find a way to make Murong Hongxue and Liu Mengning cooperate with each of his future performances…Liu Mengning…Hiss.Thinking of that woman, Su Mingyuan felt a little awkward.Not only because of his current character, in addition to the evil playboy villain, there was also a fanatical pursuit of Liu Mengning, which might cause a conflict with his future efforts to attack Xia Xueqi.It was also because Liu Mengning’s temperament was elusive, and there was no place to lure her. It would be difficult to find a way to make her completely obey the arrangement…Perhaps, she could only start with her love of art. After all, she chose to become an actor because she was very interested in art and performance…Forget it, don’t think about it so much, now that the plot has begun, cherishing the performance this time is the key.Su Mingyuan threw away the troubled thoughts in his mind, and the villain’s iconic smile returned to his face again.“Ruoruo, let’s go to the third floor.”The exhibition hall on the third floor was where all kinds of cherished and precious antiques were exhibited. They would be displayed in the exhibition hall for an hour, and then they would be auctioned in a medium-sized auction hall.If he wanted to enter the auction hall, he also needed to pay an entry fee.One hundred thousand.That was how one could go in and take a look.And only if you pay a deposit of 2 million or more, you were eligible to participate in the auction.Of course, the security deposit would be refunded in full after the auction.And Su Mingyuan.After going up to the third floor, he casually glanced at the exhibits, and then asked the bodyguard to push the crowd away and walked to the mysterious ancient jade. After watching it carefully for a while, he turned around and said arrogantly to the crowd, “You all know that I have a reputation for loving beautiful jade, Master Su. I have taken a fancy to this mysterious ancient jade. If you are interested, don’t argue with me when I auction it later. Anyway, I have a lot of money, and you can’t compete with me. ”“Of course,” saying this, his voice paused, then turned very cold, his vicious gaze swept across the audience, and he said slowly with a threatening tone, “If anyone insists on arguing with me, forcing me to spend money I bought this ancient jade at a huge price, then don’t blame me, Su Mingyuan, for finding him after the incident… to settle the account!”“Let’s go, Ruoruo.”After he finished speaking, he ignored the changing expressions on everyone’s faces, and even ignored Xiao Ran’s existence from beginning to end.He entered the auction hall with Ruoruo and the bodyguards beside him.The auction hadn’t started yet, but he obviously didn’t bother to wait outside, so he paid a deposit of 10 million yuan, and someone arranged a half-open booth for him in the auction hall.This kind of compartment was similar to a more spacious booth, and its position was higher than the ordinary seats in the hall. It did not completely cover people, so that the people below can only look up and envy. Looking at the scene where the big guy above was chatting and laughing, sipping tea lightly, and then taking down the lot with a big wave of his hand.To put it simply, sitting in such a position naturally had a kind of imposing power.And Xiao Ran.He also wanted to enter the auction hall ahead of time, and he also wanted to sit in that booth and compete with him at the same height as Su Mingyuan.But if one wanted to have such privileges, it was not enough to have money, he hd to have power, connections and reputation.He could only stand in the exhibition hall and wait.Waiting in agony.Reason told him that at this time, he should hold back his anger, choose to apologise to Su Mingyuan, and even take pictures of the Spiritual Jade as a gift to apologise to him.But emotionally, the anger that had been suppressed for a long time, especially when he was mocked by Su Mingyuan at the gate of Hongyun Building, made Xiao Ran just want to stand opposite Su Mingyuan after the auction and snatch the Spiritual Jade.Apologise, next time, okay?Xiao Ran clenched his fists.Under such torment and entanglement, time passed quickly.The auction had started.As soon as he walked into the auction hall, Xiao Ran looked up and saw Su Mingyuan sitting on it.Two bodyguards stood behind him respectfully.He was leaning on the soft and comfortable leather sofa, looking down at the stream of people. Ruoruo, who was dressed in a white dress, was as beautiful as an angel, and was sitting obediently at this moment. Tea was poured beside him.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe eyes of the two met at this moment!Su Mingyuan raised the corners of his mouth contemptuously, made a silent mouth shape, and said two words to him disdainfully, “Wilddog.”Boom!Xiao Ran’s anger flared up immediately. Seeing Su Mingyuan’s arrogant and disdainful attitude, his inner frenzied and burning emotions completely overwhelmed his reason at this moment.Today, if I don’t completely step on Su Mingyuan’s arrogant face and slap his face severely, I will not be named Xiao!As soon as Su Mingyuan saw Xiao Ran’s eyes and expressions, he immediately knew in his heart that he had completely won this performance!Perfect evaluation and 1800 villain points, he had once again been firmly in the palm of his hand!Wait, why did I just say that again?The tragedy of the last performance suddenly flashed through his mind, Su Mingyuan shook his head, and instantly threw out the unlucky thoughts that emerged from his mind.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comLast time I just missed a little bit, and this time I have learned my lesson to make up for all the loopholes. The last time that I almost ate the table can never happen again!In today’s confrontation between Xiao Ran and I, I am stable, and so is he. Isn’t this performance stable enough?I’ve planned everything like this, what else could go wrong?There can be no more problems!Perfect evaluation and 1800 villain points, I will definitely hold it in my hands!Failing is no longer possible!If I, Su Mingyuan, get another failing evaluation today, I will eat all the tables here on the spot…Su Mingyuan suddenly paused when he said this, and suddenly felt that as soon as he said the next sentence, something extremely bad seemed to happen.But how is that possible?Something like a flag, something like metaphysics, I still believe it if you say it appears on Xiao Ran, how could it appear on a villain like me?Those who stand up and fail, they fail because they are doomed to fail from the very beginning, which has nothing to do withwhether they stand up or not.In the same way, I have already made all the preparations in advance. Whether I stand up a flag or not, the result of victory is already doomed. There is no need for me to suddenly feel guilty like this?Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan’s inner confidence suddenly increased. At this time, his eyes just wandered to Ruoruo’s body, so he set up the flag without thinking:Today, if I, Su Mingyuan, get a failing evaluation again, I will take off Ruoruo’s pants when I get home, and slap her ass hard on the spot!***
