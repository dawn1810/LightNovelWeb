Looking at Murong Hongxue’s smiling eyes, the corners of Xia Xueqi’s mouth rose silently by 0.01 centimetres.Since you are so cold and cruel, don’t blame me for being the same way!“Hongxue, thank you so much for providing me with so much manpower. To be honest, they are all your people, and if they want to follow the orders, you must still be in command. My good sister, since you have decided to help me vigorously, it is better for you to come yourself. How about you come and help me too? Together, we are like a pair of swords, invincible in the world.”So I don’t have time for Mingyun’s date, do I?Watch me blow myself up with you!Facing Xia Xueqi’s playful smile and cold eyes, Murong Hongxue was completely dumbfounded.“In this confrontation, I not only calculated Xia Xueqi, but I also dug a hole and buried myself.”In the fight between Xia Xueqi and Murong Hongxue today.No one was the winner.At the same time, Su Xuelan, who was busy with a bunch of affairs yesterday, finally had some free time today.She didn’t rush to find her good brother, but couldn’t wait to start her own plan.“Mom, that… I want to tell you something…”She walked towards her mother who was sitting on the sofa watching TV……Burning Flame Building.Xiao Ran’s mood had been pretty good recently.But, there was one thing that had been stuck in his heart, like a haze that had not dissipated for a long time.That was his reputation.What happened at the Blue Rose Bar completely made his reputation stink in Ming city. So, even after Murong Hongxue sent someone over to help introduce him to the clients, the business expansion had not been going well due to his poor reputation.Well, recently, he happened to have a closer relationship with Lao Liu and Ye Tiantian.Maybe he could get the two of them to meet and help him clarify his reputation.With these two big people as guarantees, can’t my reputation be saved?Xiao Ran immediately left the building and walked to the familiar park.For some reason, he had an inexplicable self-confidence and premonition in his heart.This matter would definitely succeed!In the park, the two old men really played chess again.However, before Xiao Ran came here, two young and beautiful women appeared next to a small lake not far from where the two old men were playing chess.“Mengning, you suddenly left the hotel by yourself last night and stated you were going to ride a roller coaster, but you made me anxious. Today, why did you suddenly come to the park on a whim and decide to draw and paint?”Liu Mengning gave a smile which was filled with mystery and seduction.“Sister Xi, you don’t understand this, I’m not painting, I’m fishing.““Fishing?”“Fishing is not allowed in the park, and you don’t even have a fishing rod, are you fine?”Liu Xi looked at her blankly.Even though she had been with Liu Mengning for a long time, she still didn’t understand why Liu Mengning thought some strange things.Liu Mengning smiled without saying a word, unfolded the canvas, blended the paint, and began to paint the scenery in front of her.At the same time, Xia Rongze, who had been badly beaten by Xia Xueqi, was unhappy and wandered around with his bodyguards. They just happened to walk into this park at the same time.“Hey, did you just see those two little girls sitting by the lake painting?”“Of course I saw it!“That shape, that look, it’s so attractive! Brothers, I haven’t done this in a long time. It’s exciting to eat meat again after being a vegetarian for so long.”“Boss, this is a bit… not good, right?”“What are you afraid of? Anyway, as long as we take some intimate pictures of this women, they can only cry and let us play with them. Those two girls are so amazing, don’t you want to play with them?”Several yellow-haired gangsters stared at Liu Mengning and Liu Xi, who were sketching and painting in the park.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBecause Old Liu and Old Ye liked to come here to play chess, there were often secret guards patrolling on duty in this park. It stands to reason that nothing dangerous could possibly happen.But, no one knew why there were so many scumbags here today, and no one knew if the park’s guards had taken the wrong medicine, as if they’ve all vanished into obscurity, allowing these few scumbags to do something incomparably bad and shameless.It could only be said that it was the plot arrangement.Without creating such an opportunity, how could Xiao Ran, as the male protagonist, come to be a hero to save the beauty and get acquainted with Liu Mengning?“What kind of nonsense would dare to get in the way of this boss?”In a bad mood, Xia Rongze looked at the yellow-haired gangsters who were blocking his path and immediately ordered his bodyguards to beat them on the spot.He listened to what the gangsters said just now.So, there are two lovely ladies by the lake?Xia Rongze had wanted to find a few beauties to revive his manhood, but he had just been beaten by Xia Xueqi, which made him even more eager to rely on bullying weaker women to vent.So he went to the lake, ready to do the same despicable and shameless acts.Well, he was not much better than this rubbish, at best he was just a bigger piece of rubbish.It happened that at this moment, Su Mingyuan was wandering outside, and unknowingly entered that park.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comEven though he wanted to immediately go to Liu Mengning to fix the plot, he could only wait.But, Su Mingyuan turned into a fish to be caught by Liu Mengning.Xiao Ran, too.Xiao Ran was still making his way.—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
