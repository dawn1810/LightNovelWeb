Su Mingyuan really did not expect that Liu Mengning’s fatal blow would appear like this.But, it was not the villain Su Mingyuan who made a move, but the female protagonist herself who surrendered.Everyone present did not expect that Liu Mengning would just say such desperate words to Su Mingyuan, but she just invited him to act with her, or was he the leading actor?Could it be that he would become a couple with her?How did this seem as if Liu Mengning had given Su Mingyuan the opportunity to pursue her further?Xiao Ran never expected this sudden surprise. He was maintaining a calm and elegant smile, quietly watching Su Mingyuan as if he was a clown, powerless and agitated, desperate and unwilling, and his heart soared with joy.The result…Liu Mengning flipped the game and invited Su Mingyuan to be the leading actor in her movie?At that time, if he became popular, wouldn’t that mean my money was used to increase Su Mingyuan’s reputation?And he became the male protagonist!If there was an intimate scene between the female lead and the male lead…‘No, it will not, and it cannot!’ Xiao Ran exclaimed in his mind.Since her debut, Liu Mengning had never filmed any personal kiss scenes, and this film will not be any different!Xia Xueqi secretly clenched her fists, lowered her head, and her expression sank into darkness.She was still thinking about how Liu Mengning would add a paragraph at the conclusion of the plot today to reverse the ending, appearing to favor Su Mingyuan and enabling Xiao Ran to become furious.She didn’t expect this.Good, Liu Mengning!So, that’s your plot!When the time comes, Mingyuan will go with you to film a movie. For so many days, you are going to have fun with him, while we can only stay in Ming City and watch helplessly?Maybe you will add those sweet and intimate scenes of yours to your movie and put them on the big screen. Let us, let the audience all over the country see you showing your affection!Liu Mengning, you are really cruel!I almost thought you were my good sister before!Ruoruo also felt a little sad.If her brother Mingyuan goes to film with her sister Mengning, she will not see him for many days, and as time goes by, she will not have much time to stay with him either.Because, according to the plot, she would become a singer after a while and quickly become famous. She could shine on stage, but the time she could spend with Mingyuan’s brother would also be much less.No matter how shocked and complicated the mood of the people present was at that time.But only Su Mingyuan’s heart was bleeding.It’s over!Two big words popped into his mind.My excellent evaluation, my value of more than a thousand villain points…He seemed to see these wonderful figures float away like the wind, leaving him with a cruel and bloody reality!It’s not Xiao Ran’s cameo, but I, Su Mingyuan, will join your crew to be an actor in your movie, and not just any actor, but the leading actor?Liu Mengning, didn’t you say you’d surprise Xiao Ran and everyone else in the hall?This is what you call a surprise?!Su Mingyuan unbelievably opened his mouth, wide-eyed, looking at the beautiful Liu Mengning on the high platform.If he had just disguised a miserable appearance and was about to cry, he would now also be scared to death.Now, he really wanted to cry out.Why… Why did it become like this?Why is it that when I was about to set foot on the pedestal of victory, a shocking reversal dragged me back to the original point?Tears filled his eyes unconsciously.His expression fell into Liu Mengning’s eyes.Was it because of her words that he was moved to the verge of tears?She remembered that night when the fireworks were shining, and her knight laughingly said to her, “Of course I want to do many things, but for various reasons I haven’t yet.”He spoke incessantly, and she remembered every word he uttered.One of them she remembered clearly.“I thought if I had a chance to be in your movie, it would be nice to make a big screen appearance.”His tone was somewhat regrettable, and Liu Mengning did not want him to regret it later.Every wish of his, she would earnestly work hard to help him realise them.Obviously, this was included.This was the real surprise she wanted to prepare for Xiao Ran, to everyone in the audience, and also for her Big Hero.How could she not believe that her Big Hero was so moved that tears were about to rush out of his eyes?Liu Mengning smiled happily.“So, Mingyuan, what do you think? You wanted me to give you a chance; I gave it; would you like to take it?”What else could Su Mingyuan answer at that time?If it were in private, he might still be indifferent and sternly refuse, just as he faced Liu Mengning at the amusement park that night.But now that it was performance time, in front of Xiao Ran, in front of everyone, his character must not collapse!He could not refuse.It would be more accurate to say that he ought to feel extremely moved, much like a goddess rewarding a dog.He was in tears now, but accepted this gladly…
