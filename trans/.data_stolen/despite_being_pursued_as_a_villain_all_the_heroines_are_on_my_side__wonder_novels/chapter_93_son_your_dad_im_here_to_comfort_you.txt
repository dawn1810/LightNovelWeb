This night, for Xiao Ran, was an unfortunate and bloody night.But for Su Mingyuan, except for the small frustration caused by the failure of the performance.He really had a blast that night!Ruoruo, the sweet girl, really didn’t know how to refuse. She was forced to give in because of shyness…You are always like this, I’m really afraid that one day I can’t help but turn into a big bad wolf and eat you little white rabbit!Oh, I still have a rule that the villain can’t take the initiative to violate the female protagonist, so it’s fine.This night, Su Mingyuan successfully fulfilled his promise and punished Ruoruo severely, causing the moonlight to ripple like a spring tide in the night sky.And with the help of Ruoruo’s little hand, Su Mingyuan successfully regained his composure.The only pity was that Ruoruo was too shy to turn on the lights, making it difficult for Su Mingyuan to appreciate the beautiful and shy beauty.And in order to prove that he was really beating the heroine and not violating the heroine, he still used a little force when he started, making a crisp sound, and did not turn the beating into a touch.This touch would definitely be deducted from the villain points!But overall, the experience was great and the feel was soft and supple.With Ruoruo’s effort to suppress her moan, she still couldn’t help but let out a faint whisper, Su Mingyuan even felt that even if he failed every time in the future, as long as he could enjoy such an experience later, it didn’t seem to be a big loss.Ruoruo, you have already achieved this level for me now, no matter how you are acting, you still have some place for me in your heart, right?And……Even if you could follow such outrageous orders of mine, even if you don’t really love me, as long as I issue more orders in the future, I will make you accustomed to obeying my orders and commands.Then as long as I issue an order in the future, I believe that you will also blindly follow my instructions in conditioned reflex, and will not have any thoughts of resistance.Ruoruo, you have already entered my company, you can’t escape, hahahaha!Su Mingyuan laughed silently in his heart, and finally ended the fun night with two kisses as a reward, and returned to his room.Hmm, before he knew it, he seemed to have gotten a little bit bad.But……If Ruoruo took the initiative to be an undercover agent, then if I am a little bit bad to her, it is also very reasonable and I can’t be blamed, right?Su Mingyuan fell asleep without any psychological burden.If you have any problems or troubles, leave it to tomorrow to solve it, and you must not delay your sleep time tonight.And after Su Ming left, Ruoruo went to the bathroom to wash her hands, and with a blush she lay on the bed hugging the quilt, and the previous scene kept playing in her mind.It used to be the same, every time I kissed Mingyuan’s brother, when I was intimate with him, my body would become weird, especially after being beaten there today, my body became especially weird.I feel hot and dizzy. My mind is a mess with strang thoughts.And……She bit her lower lip unconsciously, her fingers dipping down unconsciously.It is getting weird, like it wants something, wanting to be filled with something…Uh…uh…Ruoruo stretched out her fingers self-taught, and a charming coquettish moan suddenly appeared from her tightly sealed lips, and a mist-like haze suddenly appeared in her clear eyes which was clear like lake water.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comWuwuwu, Brother Mingyuan, I’m sorry, Ruoruo… Ruoruo has really become a bad girl……………When the sunlight awakened the vitality of the city, and the birds outside the window were chirping on the branches, Su Mingyuan stretched and got up comfortably from the bed.Today, it was time to pretend to be a white knight to comfort his unsatisfactory son.Just send him the spiritual jade he gave me last night, Su Mingyuan thought.He didn’t feel any distress, because according to the plot, this was originally something that belonged to Xiao Ran.Taking the things that Xiao Ran gave him and returning them to Xiao Ran, he could also give him a wave of goodwill.It was a no-brainer deal.During breakfast, Su Mingyuan found that Ruoruo had her head dropped down compared to usual, and seemed a little afraid to look at him.Especially when his eyes fell on her upturned little ass, the look of dodging was even more obvious.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAfter doing that, this little white rabbit was so shy.Su Mingyuan smiled slightly, reached out and grabbed her by his side, pinched her red cheeks and joked, “Ruoruo, looking at you being so guilty and shy, shouldn’t you have done something bad behind my back?”“No… no! Brother Mingyuan!”Ruoruo retorted fiercely and loudly, and stretched her hand down as if to cover up something, but when she reached halfway, she suddenly her mistake, and her little hand suddenly froze in the air. Not knowing what to do, she fiddled around indiscriminately, and her small face instantly became hot and crimson.Su Mingyuan didn’t expect her reaction to be so intense. Looking at her performance, wouldn’t she really do something bad behind his back?For example, took the opportunity to make a small report to Xiao Ran again?Ruoruo, Ruoruo, I originally let go of my guard against you. I haven’t watched the surveillance watch for a long time. I didn’t expect you…Su Mingyuan responded to Ruoruo in a perfunctory manner, and immediately rushed to the monitoring room on the second floor as soon as he left the restaurant after dinner.Ruoruo, you must have not think of it!I have already set up the secret surveillance in this villa!What the hell did you tell Xiao Ran behind my back? Let me, Detective Su Mingyuan, come and find out today!He immediately turned on the monitoring playback, found Ruoruo’s room, and started playing the video.Then……The smug look on his face froze.Turned into shock, then surprise, and finallyinto embarrassed ecstasy!Ruoruo, that… I’m sorry.I really don’t know that the bad things you did behind my back turned out to be this kind of bad things. I really didn’t mean to peep on you or anything, it’s just a coincidence, you know?Ruoruo, that what…Isn’t there something to say?I, Su Mingyuan, never give up halfway in doing things, so I definitely can’t give up this principle this time, and I will definitely insist on watching it. You… should understand me, right?So so…So……After a while, Su Mingyuan rushed downstairs, found Ruoruo, and asked for her help.He dressed up as a white knight to comfort his son.Be sure to stay calm before getting down to business.The most important thing now was that he needed to replenish energy, and he needed Ruoruo’s comfort to calm down his violently fluctuating mood.After half an hour.Satisfied, Su Mingyuan put on the white knight suit and set off with high spirits.Son, your sister just helped me soothe my excitement.Now it’s my turn to comfort you!***
