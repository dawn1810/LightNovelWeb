The situation reversed in an instant.Offensive and defensive sides were exchanged.Just now, Su Mingyuan, who was showing a high-spirited look because of teasing Xia Xueqi to the point of blushing, suddenly became speechless, and was suppressed by Xia Xueqi’s aggressive aura.Get it right?The person who was being suppressed and pinched now was him.Xia Xueqi saw the fiasco with her own eyes, so how could he suddenly think of a reason to explain it?He was flustered now.Damn it!Why!Xia Xueqi had just been maddened by me that she couldn’t even lift up her spirits. How could she still have the time to observe these details, and she suddenly sensed my flaws?Damn bad woman!Etc., etc!Don’t panic.What if I am discovered?At this moment, Su Mingyuan became wise in a hurry, and suddenly thought of an excuse.“Strange? Oh, what’s so strange?”He spread his hands, leaned his back on the sofa, looked disdainful and indifferent, saying lazily, “Master Su is in a good mood just after eating your tofu, so I decided to show mercy and forgive his mistakes. What’s wrong? Can’t I?“And that night, Xiao Ran’s bastard pissed me off, the woman just happened to be a little pretty, so I thought about putting her on the bed and venting it hard, why not?“Xia Xueqi, you can’t even figure out such a simple reason, tsk tsk tsk, then I really have to wonder if you’ve just been playing with me and your face is red because your brain has burned out!”Not only was Su Mingyuan impatient, but his words showed that he was such a moody villain, and he even spat out a bloodyreply, saying that it was you, Xia Xueqi, who had a brain problem, and that the strange person was you!However, Xia Xueqi only used one sentence lightly, and completely defeated his disguise.She looked at Su Mingyuan quietly, her eyes as deep and unwavering as a secluded pool, as if she could see through his heart.She said, “Mingyuan, you are guilty.”“Guilty? How can I have a guilty conscience? Why should I have a guilty conscience!”Hearing this, Su Mingyuan smiled disdainfully, tugged at his collar, and immediately retorted, “I’m such a moody playboy. When I’m in a good mood, adults can forgive others’ mistakes. When I’m in a bad mood, even if a person who is not pleasing to the eye appears in front of me, I want to kill him. You don’t even know that. You know, you can’t even see that?!”He seemed a little excited, almost in a state of madness.In Xia Xueqi’s eyes, she found him strangely cute.The corners of her mouth rose slightly by a few tenths of a centimetre. Instead of taking Su Mingyuan’s words to heart, she said, “Mingyuan, do you know? Legend has it that in ancient times, an unknown bird lived on the extremely cold Tianshan Mountain Range. Although the Tianshan Mountain Range was barren and cold, birds had extremely sharp beaks that could help them pierce through. They even pierced ice and the rocks to find tiny creatures living under them, so they survived intact until they were discovered by the ancients.”“Do you know why they went extinct?”Su Mingyuan was stunned for a moment, looked at Xia Xueqi, thought about it, and said, “Because…their mouths are very hard, suitable for weapons?”“Mingyuan, it seems that you are quite self-aware.” Xia Xueqi covered her mouth and laughed lightly.#pleasereadthischapertatwondernovels.comIt was only now that Su Mingyuan suddenly reacted, this bad woman was taunting him just now, but he was foolishly fooled by her and scolded himself!There was even a sound of auditory hallucinations in his ears at this time, and he heard a voice in a trance saying: Thank you for the plane that was still stubbornly delivered~~“Xia Xueqi, I advise you not to deceive people too much!”At this moment, he was anxious to start calling Xia Xueqi by her name.Xia Xueqi didn’t answer. She just covered her mouth and giggled.After a while she said, “Mingyuan, next time you remember a guilty conscience, don’t say so many words all at once, and don’t rush to refute the moment you are ridiculed by others. Look at you, your neck is even red with excitement, and even your collar is loose already.”Boom!Su Mingyuan almost couldn’t help smashing his fist on the table.Damn Xia Xueqi, after taunting me, she still pretended to teach me kindly?Don’t talk too much when you are still guilty, don’t rush to refute when you are ridiculed? I still need you to teach me, Su Mingyuan?If I hadn’t really panicked just now, with my actor-like acting skills, do you think I’d let you see the flaws?Hateful!Damn!I, Su Mingyuan, managed to suppress her, playing with her until she was out of breath and flushed.Unexpectedly, it was just a lack of attention, and he was once again suppressed by her, and he was pinched in the palm of her hand!Su Mingyuan was extremely annoyed and regretted it now!There was even a trace of confusion.Now that the disguise had been broken, how should he… explain to Xia Xueqi?Or just… don’t explain?Yes, no explanation!His eyes suddenly lit up.Yes, that’s it!I won’t tell you, hey, I’m just messing around, I’m just playing, you Xia Xueqi are my Su Mingyuan, why should I tell you?Facing Xia Xueqi’s playful smile and the projected line of sight, Su Mingyuan simply turned his head to one side, pretending not to see it, pretending that he was obsessively admiring the scenery outside the window.Ah, this little lake, this willow, this breeze, this sun…Gorgeous!So lovely!Waiter, waiter? Where is the waiter?Why haven’t you served yet?Hurry up and serve it!Seeing the appearance of Su Mingyuan dressed as an ostrich, Xia Xueqi took out her mobile phone and took a few pictures of the silencer, and then looked at him with a smile and said, “Mingyuan, why did you suddenly dare not meet my eyes?”“Don’t bother me, I’m looking at the scenery outside the window!”“Am I beautiful?”“…”“Why don’t you speak and answer my previous question?”“…”“I see, Mingyuan, you are afraid that if you talk too much, you will lose, so you are determined to say nothing at all, and let me guess in my heart?”#pleasereadthischapertatwondernovels.comXia Xueqi stood up from her position.When the situation returned to her control again, she no longer needed to sit across from Su Mingyuan to avoid his physical contact.On the contrary, the one who now chooses to escape, It was Su Mingyuan.She walked to Su Mingyuan’s side, leaned over slightly to get close to his body, and said slowly, “Then let me guess, why you that night and you today have such completely different reactions to the same thing.”“Why after these two dates, I found out that you are slightly different from the Su Mingyuan I remembered before.”Her delicate red lips slowly moved to Su Mingyuan’s ear, and gently blew against his earlobe, “Mingyuan, shouldn’t you have been…”She paused, and when Su Mingyuan was extremely nervous and his heart was beating frantically, she blew softly into his ear again, which made his whole body tremble, and his body trembled visibly before saying, “… Acting, acting, right?”As soon as this statement came out, Su Mingyuan suddenly had a sudden cardiac arrest.The roles switch instantly.Now, he became the one who was gently blowing in her ear, who was completely pinched and played.In the palm of her hand.***
