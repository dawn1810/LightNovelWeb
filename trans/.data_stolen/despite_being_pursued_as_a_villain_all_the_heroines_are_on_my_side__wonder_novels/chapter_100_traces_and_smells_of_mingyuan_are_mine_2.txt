She walked to the opposite side of Murong Hongxue and sat down, the corner of her mouth raised slightly by 0.01 cm, and she began to discuss business with her.…………As soon as Su Mingyuan left Lingxue Pavilion, he suddenly realised something.The reason why he came to Murong Hongxue before was not to do such intimate pleasures with her. He came to Xing Shi to ask interrogate her and why she was targeting his stupid son Xiao Ran!Oops, I was too indulgent for a while, and I forgot about the business.He patted his head and suddenly woke up.But he didn’t plan to go back and ask again.Or many and a half were the same as he guessed before, the main reason was that the Su Xia family was behind the scenes, and she just followed the trend.Moreover, the biggest gain of this trip was to win the heart of a peerless beauty in vain.Judging from Murong Hongxue’s admiration for him, and seeing him as the light that illuminated her life, it was estimated that she was another obedient baby like Ruoruo.Wouldn’t it be easier for him, as a director, to arrange a plot in the future?Attack the beauty, make her shy, and then order her not to interfere with my acting career.Unconsciously, Su Mingyuan’s way of doing things had begun to change in this direction.Now if one thinks about it carefully, the five heroines in the early stage of the plot, Su Xuelan, was the sister who doted on him. Murong Hongxue regarded him as the light of redemption.Of the five heroines, he got three.Xia Xueqi also admired him because she thought she saw through his true face on the last date, and maybe she could get rid of her with a little effort.At that time, he would get the fourth of the five major female protagonists, so why worry about the great cause?It was almost done!Sure enough, the previous failures were just to help him accumulate experience and lessons.Through this time and again, he had already vaguely figured out the secret to truly clearing the game this week.By getting 300 villain points every time you perform badly, can you barely get 50,000 villain points to go home after two years?Ah!When I take down Xia Xueqi, find a way to deal with Liu Mengning, and speed up this week within half a year, it won’t be a problem!At this moment, Su Mingyuan’s high-spirited look at the beginning of the week seemed to return to him.Ambition was burning within him again.He was in a good mood now, and he couldn’t help but want to do something to vent and share this joyful emotion with others.Just before he knew it, he walked to the overpass where he sang before.It happened to be on the overpass, and the wandering singer happened to be singing there. Compared with the last time, his singing skills have improved significantly. It seemed that he had listened to his instructions.The moment he saw him, the guy’s eyes lit up, and he stopped singing halfway through the song. He hurriedly ran over to ask him, the master, to give him more advice. If he was lucky enough to listen to his singing voice that day, That was even more of an honour.Su Mingyuan was in a good mood now, and of course he would not refuse. He gave him a few words at will, took the guitar and started singing.This joyful mood was just conveyed by singing, and it was also used to make all happy or unhappy people feel a relaxed and joyful state of mind.For a time, the beautiful singing reverberated on the flyover again, and almost all the people passing by were attracted by the singing, gathered together, and even caused traffic jams.Of course, Su Mingyuan’s performance was filmed again by someone with a heart and posted it on the Internet.But he didn’t care at all.Anyway, no one knew that the person under the mask was Su Mingyuan.After singing a few songs, Su Mingyuan slipped away, pretended not to run, and stayed here to be blocked by people, waiting for the crazy crowd to come up to reveal his mask?Unconsciously, he wandered into a park.In the park, two white-haired and spirited old men were playing chess.Su Mingyuan hadn’t gone to the park to play chess with the old men for a long time. After seeing their fiasco, he showed an expression of disbelief and shock, even scratching his ears and cheeks. He couldn’t help but lean forward a little.At the same time, the Burning Flame Building.Xiao Ran suddenly remembered that when he went to the park to relax in the past few days, he always met two old men playing chess.At that time, he had a hunch that he felt that great things would happen when he got in touch with these two old men.He had always believed in this hunch, and this hunch always came true, often bringing him good luck, so he joined them and became chess friends.His skills were good, and he was often inseparable from one of the old men surnamed Ye, which was a rare time for him to relax.It just so happens that I have nothing to do today, so let’s go to the park to play chess with these two old men.Thinking of this, he immediately left the company and set off for the park.In the park, Su Mingyuan, who was watching the battle for a while, was also noticed by the two old men at this moment.One of the two had a long white beard on the chin, the other did not.There was also a gap in their level. The long-bearded old man was obviously of a higher rank. Killing the other party was to lose his helmet and remove his armour, and the whole line collapses.“Old Liu, it’s really boring to play chess with you. After playing for so many years, why haven’t you improved your chess skills?” The long-bearded old man stroked his beard and smiled proudly.The old man called Old Liu smiled, as if he was used to his appearance, but he didn’t say anything. Noticing Su Mingyuan, who had been watching the battle for a long time, he said.“There are not many young people who are willing to calm down and play chess and watch chess. I met one a few days ago, but I didn’t expect to meet another one today.”He didn’t feel any strange offence because of Su Mingyuan’s handsome and handsome dress, and he invited, “Little friend, I see that you have been watching the game for a long time. I think you are interested in playing chess. Are you interested in playing a game with the old man opposite Ye and helping me kill his spirit?”Seeing the long-bearded old man Ye’s triumphant look after winning, Su Mingyuan immediately agreed.He just liked to play chess against such opponents, and he liked to see them defeated, the expression on his face from smug to shock to disbelief to frustration and frustration, murmuring “Impossible!” “How can this happen?!”“Young man, do you want me to give you two sons? Cannons, horses, chariots, you can choose whatever you want!”Seeing old man Ye’s “you are a junior, I let you” look like a master, Su Mingyuan couldn’t help but want to laugh.##pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comHe did not refuse, and chose two children at random, with a humble and flattered look on his face.“Then thank you sir.”He was very good at torturing these little old men.The other party gave him two sons first, and he would definitely not accept the defeat.Then it’s “Junior, I will let you go play with one more pieces.”After losing this time, he would definitely change his words to “Little friend, this time I will not let you down. This time, I will use all my skills to convince you!”#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comIf this failed, he would definitely not be discouraged, and even start cheating and let himself start to give in.But it doesn’t matter, you let me have two pieces at the beginning, then I will also respect the old man.Let you have a piercing first, and defeat you.Usually by this time, the other party’s mentality had completely collapsed.At that time, Su Mingyuan could appreciate the chameleon’s wonderfully changing expression on the other side.
