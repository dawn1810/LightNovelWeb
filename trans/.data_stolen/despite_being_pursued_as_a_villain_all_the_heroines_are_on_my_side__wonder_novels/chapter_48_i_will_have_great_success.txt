In the previous show, the reason he got a bad score was mostly because he didn’t successfully let Xiao Ran insult him, and instead Xiao Ran was insulted by Xia Xueqi.Moreover, for the next scene, Xiao Ran had to insult him in the face and he had to make sure none of it went wrong.The first hit on the face would be because Xiao Ran was an acquaintance of Ye Chen, who was from a rich family, and it was a success.For the next few days, Su Mingyuan sent someone to keep an eye on Ye Chen, to see whether he kept in contact with Xiao Ran. If there’s no contact, he would create an opportunity for Xiao Ran to see eye to eye with him and become friends.For the second one, naturally, when Xiao Ran saw injustice and saved the poor waitress from him.As long as nothing went wrong with the waitress, this time’s face hitting would be successful.Well, just in case, he would find someone to investigate the waitress’s personality and background, to see if there’s anything different from the original one.​​In case something goes wrong, he had to arrange a waitress in advance to let Xiao Ran’s pretence to be successful.As for the third one, naturally it would be when he just finished saying harsh words, he would face murderous stares from a group of big men. At that moment he was almost scared to the point he wet himself and had to leave in dismay.This should not be a concern, there would be no problem.Thinking about it like this, it didn’t seem like there would be any accident, everything would be stable.‘No, I shouldn’t think that way. I almost forgot the ultimate factor that caused me a great deal the previous two times.’‘These darn bipolar female protagonists!’‘Although, according to the plot, Murong Hongxue would not appear in this show.’‘But what if?’‘What if she happened to be at the Blue Rose Bar that day, and if she, like other heroines, changes her personality and messes up my show?’After the first two failures, Su Mingyuan didn’t want to take any chances now and wasn’t afraid to consider the worst possible outcome.Therefore, he also needed to ensure that on the day of the show, Murong Hongxue was not at the bar!Actually, this wasn’t really that difficult, as long as Murong Hongxue was asked to go somewhere else that night.And the person to ask her out …. Of course Murong Hongxue wouldn’t give him any face as a scoundrel, but his sister was Su Xuelan, who seemed to be the next heir of the Su family so far.Murong Hongxue would definitely give her a face and go to meet her.Just like this, all unexpected factors were ruled out.And his show was bound to be a success!Thinking of the large amount of villain coins he would get, Su Mingyuan was full of expectations.‘This time, Xiao Ran, you have to succeed in pretending!’Maybe someone would ask, Su Mingyuan, in order to get the villain points, you are very excited to be hit by Xiao Ran constantly who is pretending. Are you a psychopath?Su Mingyuan’s answer would be that although he was very optimistic and had a great attitude, it did not mean that he would be like a pervert who had a sense of comfort when he was beaten and humiliated.However ….The one to be hit at face qas the image of villain portrayed by Su Mingyuan, and what was its connection with real Su Mingyuan?He was just doing a performance, only performing as a bad villain.He wouldn’t get into it.Moreover, his life was not always filled with Xiao Ran pretending to insult him at any time.He just performed to get insulted by protagonist every few days. As for the rest of the time, he used the identity of Su Minyuan to enjoy a lot of things.He had never tasted delicacies and all kinds of experiences that only the rich could enjoy in his previous life. Occasionally, he would go and find some women with the best figure to relax and entertain himself.Of course, he didn’t write this down in his diary.……In addition, when he was young, he saw youngsters playing Go (Chinese chess board game), and he wanted to learn. Unfortunately, even after he grew up, he still didn’t have time to learn, so he used the enhancement points to buy master-level chess skills from the system, not only Go, but also all kinds of games like Elephant Chess, Chinese Checkers, Chess, Gomoku…When he went to the park to play chess with those old men, he never lost!He also liked singing. Unfortunately, his voice was not so good, so he bought a master-level voice and master-level music creation. In his spare time, he wrote and sing songs to improve his mood.When he was a child, he wanted to be a painter, so he bought master-level painting skills.When he was in college, he liked playing games very much, but sadly he was a noob, so he bought a master-level E-sports knowledge and manual ….There were also master-level maths knowledge, master-level gun proficiency, master-level fighting skills, master-level medical proficiency, etc …All of these happened last week. Although he had this much knowledge and skills, he couldn’t show them in front of others.But since he saved the female protagonist once as a knight in white, he often wore a white windbreaker and covered the upper half of his face with a white mask similar to a masquerade mask. He went out to make trouble in his spare time and made many other nicknames.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comHow to put it, there was even a hint of secret pretence.Although he had to redo this week once again, actually this was also the reason Su Mingyuan wasn’t very angry and furious.It was just that he didn’t expect that this week would become bigger because of the destruction of the world, and he had to spend more time and energy to get the plot back on track.Even worse.Now, his strength couldn’t even compare with Xia Xueqi!Without a strong and tall physique, how could he dress up as a knight in white to have fun and relieve his loneliness that stemmed from being unable to return home for the time being?Cultivation, he needed to cultivate!So in the next few days, instead of teasing and testing Xiao Ruoruo, he took out a batch of good-grade jade from his collection and worked hard to cultivate.Of course, he would not touch the highest-grade jade in his collection. Those were extremely rare and precious spirit jade like the dragon essence jade he wore around his waist. After all, this would be Xiao Ran’s future drop items.When he was tired of cultivating, he would hum songs, play chess on the Internet, or start a game to abuse the noobs, enjoying the feeling of being praised and begged by others.Every day, Ruoruo looked at him with a smiling face and cooked for him. It was a really pleasant life.Of course, he did not forget his business.In these few days, two of his bodyguards who were beaten and sent to the hospital finally returned.He also inquired about the news that the third uncle of the Xia family returned to the Xia family with a gloomy face a few days ago. It seemed like he had fallen on the road and suffered some minor injuries.And his fiancee, Xia Xueqi, also brought Xiao Ran to a reception. Of course, because his role was just to be her partner, Xiao Ran didn’t even hold her hand the whole time.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comSu Mingyuan knew that it seemed that with his efforts to remedy, the plot had finally returned to its track.Not only that, but two days ago, Ye Chen from the Ye family was racing in Yanming Mountain  with Xiao Ran who became friends upon first meeting, and he exclaimed that Xiao Ran was the god of the race.A group of foreigners landed at Ming City airport by plane.The waitress that he asked someone to investigate, as expected, was as poor as in the story. She went to Ming City Film Academy and had a stubborn personality. She worked in the Blue Rose Bar but did not sell herself.Looking at the collected information, Su Mingyuan smiled with satisfaction.‘Very good, very good, everything is ready, now we only need to wait for the East wind to blow.’‘As long as the unexpected factor, Murong Hongxue, was sent away, and his sister asked her out.’‘I will have great success in this show!’***
