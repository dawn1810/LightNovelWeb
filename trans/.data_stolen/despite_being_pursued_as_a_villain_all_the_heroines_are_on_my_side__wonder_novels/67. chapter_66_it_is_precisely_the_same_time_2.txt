Even so, although there was no shortage of food and clothing in life, she still lacked the love she craved since her birth.Her father hated her, even disgusted her, and did not necessarily see her more than once a year.In the place of the ancient Murong family, she was even more subject to the cold-eyed ridicule and mockery of everyone.The adults were better off, but they just looked at her coldly and occasionally gossiped behind her back.The youngsters, on the other hand, didn’t seem to mind. They called her a “bitch-raised bastard,”, “Gutter rat,”, and “dirty and disgusting garbage.”She was a stain on the Murong family, a dirty existence in the eyes of everyone, and she was not liked by anyone, let alone expected by anyone.She seemed to have been engraved with the word “dirty” as a mark from birth.From birth to adulthood, from the slums of the city to the powerful and glorious Murong family, the twisted inferiority and viciousness were carved into her bones from childhood.And when she became an adult, she chose to leave Murong’s family and come to Ming City to enter the dark side of the city again.She stepped on the mountain of bones and became the underground queen of Ming City.Those trash in the slums who had once laughed at her no longer dared to look at her with mocking eyes.But this was not enough …..Furthermore the Murong family…“Miss Murong, don’t be angry.” Su Mingyuan’s voice pulled her back to reality.He stretched out his hand, and the Radiant Jade True Qi of the eleven-year skill was running at full strength, slowly breaking open Murong Hongxue’s fingers that were holding his collar.After disturbing her state of mind, this was time to show his strength.And prying Murong Hongxue’s fingers open with his hand was a test of strength.Murong Hongxue practised the Murong Family’s hidden black demon fantasy scripture, and Su Mingyuan practised the Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill.As they put their strength to the test, they each discover the breadth of the other’s abilities.To be precise, Murong Hongxue was much stronger than Su Mingyuan.But Su Mingyuan immediately spent 100 strengthening points to buy a Ten Years of True Qi (One-day Duration)], and immediately suppressed her back.A look of shock appeared in Murong Hongxue’s eyes, then she withdrew her True Qi and stared at his mask-covered face, “Who the hell are you!”“It doesn’t matter who I am, what matters is that I, as well as my brother Xiao Ran, can help you.” Su Mingyuan began to make things up. “Xiao Ran is your senior brother?”“Almost….. right. You should have just felt my strength, but my senior brother, Xiao Ran, is several times stronger than me!”Su Mingyuan started luring her in by stating, “As long as you are willing to give him face and leave last night’s matter as it is, and then form an alliance with him, he can definitely help you accomplish that!”Murong Hongxue said with a sneer, “Murong Family’s presence is stronger than Xiao Ran’s, do you think he can help me?”“So, then if I tell you …… my senior brother Xiao Ran did not start cultivating since he was a child, it only took him less than eight years to cultivate to a strength several times stronger than mine!”Su Mingyuan’s mouth revealed a mysterious smile, “In this way, do you think he is qualified to ally with you?”“Eight years?” Murong Hongxue was slightly shocked, and then fell silent.Xiao Ran became so strong in just eight years. So in a few years, wouldn’t he really have a chance to help her overthrow or control the Murong family?This was what Su Mingyuan wanted to express.Hearing this, Murong Hongxue pondered for a long time, as if she had been tangled in thought, but the light from the corner of her eyes shone delicately on Su Mingyuan’s body.It wasn’t until she had seen enough that she said slowly, “This matter… I can give him a face, and tomorrow at ten o’clock in the morning, you will let him come to the Fairview Building to find me.”“Okay!”Su Mingyuan prepared to leave.Next was to find a way to inform Xiao Ran.Just at this moment, Murong Hongxue suddenly reached out and pulled him back.“Wait.”“Since you know so much and know what I want to do, then you naturally also know everything that happened to me.”#[email protected]“That’s natural.” Su Mingyuan nodded and turned his head to look at her, a look that could completely seen through her.He needed to create such an unpredictable human setup in front of Murong Hongxue, so that the next time he had a problem, he could come to her for help.“Then …… I’ll ask you a question.”Murong Hongxue stared into his eyes, grabbed his hand so tightly that her voice suddenly became a little softer, “Do you think I’m… dirty?”The scene in front of him was so familiar yet unfamiliar.Looking at these eyes, Su Mingyuan seemed to have once again returned to the time when Murong Hongxue asked him this sentence last week.And Murong Hongxue looked at the white knight who was close at hand, looked at his familiar dress and face, in a trance as if she was back to her past life when she asked him the question uneasily.#[email protected]At the time, she had already had an encounter with Su Mingyuan, who was dressed as a white knight and was considered a relatively backward point in the plot.She was assassinated by someone from the Murong family and was seriously injured and hunted down.When Su Mingyuan, disguised as a white knight, rushed to rescue her. He found that she was actually one of the dancers in Ye’s Inn who were often scolded as a whore behind their backs and secretly hid them without being discovered, until he arrived in time.At that time, her mood was extremely fluctuating and it was difficult to calm down.The reason why she was treated as a dirty and unpleasant existence from birth was because her mother was criticised as a whore.But the reason why she survived when she was a child was only because of the occasional help from her mother’s co-workers who were also scolded as whore.The fact that this absurdity appeared before her, everything seemed to remind her of the past when she was regarded as a dirty existence, and made her pain and contradictions constantly erupt in inner conflict.So at that moment, seeing the white knight Su Mingyuan who came to her rescue, the inferiority complex that had been suppressed in the bottom of her heart could no longer be suppressed.#[email protected]She told him everything, her lowly origin, dark past, her twisted heart…She grew up in the eyes of everyone as a dirty existence, she grew up doing things so dirty, so unscrupulous, but, but she also longed…Finally, after telling everything, her emotions had almost collapsed, and she grabbed his hand nervously and forcefully, stared into his eyes, and asked him in a trembling voice, “Do you think I am… dirty?”………………“Do you think I am… dirty?”The question from before, and this moment in front of him seemed to overlap in a flash.In the face of the same question, Su Mingyuan looked at Murong Hongxue’s eyes, smiled softly, and said the same answer, “You are not dirty.”***
