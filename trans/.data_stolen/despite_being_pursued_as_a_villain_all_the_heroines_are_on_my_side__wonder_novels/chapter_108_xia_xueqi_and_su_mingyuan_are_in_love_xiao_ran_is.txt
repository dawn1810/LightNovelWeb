In the cinema.“You said that to Xiao Ran just now, aren’t you afraid of really irritating him? After all, he is also your partner.”Just walking into the cinema, Su Mingyuan couldn’t help asking.“Partners? Oh, just object,” Xia Xueqi said disdainfully.She shook the hands they held together, and said with a light smile, “Besides, Mingyuan, you are my ally and my fiancé, he, Xiao Ran’s face is half as important as your mood?”“Xueqi, your speech is a bit of a tease. It makes me a little doubtful that if one day there is a greater interest in front of you, you will treat me like Xiao Ran just now.”“You’re right, Mingyuan. So…”Xia Xueqi suddenly stopped and approached his body.She stood on tiptoe slightly, raised his chin frivolously, and a faint smirk appeared at the corner of her mouth. The rounded towering pair were only less than two centimetres away from Su Mingyuan’s chest at this moment.The straightening made Su Mingyuan’s cheeks warm slightly, and his heart began to pound again.Just when he thought that this bad woman was going to kiss him, and he was nervous and excitedly looking forward to it, her delicate white face brushed his lips lightly, and said in his ear, “Mingyuan, you have to do your best. As long as I fall in love with you with all my heart, you will never have to worry about this happening, and even then no matter what you want to do, no matter how you want to pull me, this high-ranking bad woman. Down to the world, under your body…”“It’s all possible~”Xia Xueqi’s provocative and tempting voice was like his succubus whispering softly in his ear, plus she gently spit out hot and humid air breathing in his ear, Su Mingyuan’s heart was itchy, crisp, and numb. .The whole little heart trembled with excitement, wishing to hold this damn bad woman tightly in his arms, and then stretch out his big hand to beat her ass and give her a good lesson.Let you tease me like this, let you tease me like this, right?See if I don’t make you suffer severe punishment now!“Mingyuan, look at your red face.” Xia Xueqi smiled charmingly, and poked his finger lightly at his heart, “Your heart is beating so fast, don’t fall in love before I fall in love with you. Come on me.”“Because when the time comes, maybe I will hold you under my body and use high heels, candles and a whip to make you enjoy another kind of… happiness.”She pinched Su Mingyuan’s hot cheeks, cast a teasing and charming look at him, and then licked the corners of her lips in a very provocative way, which stimulated Su Mingyuan’s blood to surge back, straight to his brain.Oh shit!Damn bad woman!You wait, after I take your strategy, I must take you…At this moment, Su Mingyuan suddenly found something sad.That is, unless he takes a risk of deducting the villain points, even in bed, he is likely to be passive and pushed back…He was completely stunned.Perhaps……Sometimes, it’s a good idea to try passive…Bah bah bah!What am I thinking!How can a real man choose to be passive!Even if I, Su Mingyuan, died here. I jumped from the outside and fell to my death, and I would never choose to be passive, let alone feel any happiness in this passive process!A real man is to be just!“You’re right, Xueqi.”The corners of his mouth rose, he smiled frivolously, took Xia Xueqi’s other hand, pressed it against his heart, then leaned down slightly, facing her face to face.Isn’t it just a straight ball attack?Who wouldn’t!“Have you felt my heartbeat, Xueqi? This feeling of scorching and beating because of you.”His fingers gently rubbed her smooth and delicate chin slowly, then squeezed it gently, and raised it slightly upward, so that her full and delicate red lips were gently aligned with his own, until the gap was less than one centimetre.“Xueqi, is your heartbeat slightly excited because of my approach?”Su Mingyuan’s smile and eyes were so charming, his hot breath was intertwined with her.The air seemed to be getting hot at this moment, her brain was heating up, her cheeks were getting hot. Xia Xueqi seemed to be under magic, she stood there and didn’t dare to move.She could clearly feel that one of her hands was clasping Mingyuan’s fingers tightly, and the other hand was feeling his scorching heart.His fingers touched her chin softly and provocatively, the affectionate eyes looking at her were so seductive. She saw him leaning down slightly, his lips getting closer and closer to hers, about to kiss…In fact, her heartbeat never slowed down from the beginning to the end, and she was extremely excited at this moment.She had been enduring, acting very calm, showing the appearance that everything was under her control, but at this moment, she could no longer pretend.The shy blushing quietly covered her face, smearing this frosty and inviolable face into a charming pink blurred face.She grabbed his palm tightly and closed her eyes involuntarily.Then……Su Mingyuan’s cheek brushed her face, brushed her lips, and whispered to her in herear, “Xueqi, I now believe that you won’t do the same thing to me as Xiao Ran, because your blushing cheeks look like I’m asking for a kiss…”He blew lightly on her sensitive earlobes, which stimulated Xia Xueqi’s body to tremble slightly, and then said with a wicked smile, “…It’s like a charming and dissatisfied concubine asking for the emperor’s favour.”Click!Su Mingyuan laughed wickedly as he spoke.He didn’t kiss him as Xia Xueqi expected, but returned her to him in the same way, and the most extreme thing was that he even took a photo secretly at this time!Seeing Xia Xueqi open her eyes with a disappointed and stunned look, Su Mingyuan’s laughter couldn’t help but grow louder.Isn’t it alluring?Xueqi, don’t think you are the only one who can do this trick!Su Mingyuan raised the photo he just took on his phone with a proud look on his face.Because of her embarrassment, Xia Xueqi’s cheeks turned a little red again, and she looked even more full of the temptation and taste of a woman.But she didn’t really get angry because of this.Isn’t this kind of teasing and teasing just a little fun between lovers?As long as Mingyuan doesn’t do such a thing to other women.She pursed her lips and snorted softly, reached out and pinched the soft flesh around Su Mingyuan’s waist, and he immediately cooperated and pretended to be in pain and screamed.She gave him a glamorous glance, which was considered to have exposed the matter. The two walked to the couple’s seat holding hands and sat down.There were only the two of them in the huge movie hall, and Su Mingyuan had already reserved the entire movie theatre.The lights were extinguished at the right time, the darkness could easily arouse the primitive fear of human beings, and the silent environment would amplify the stimulation of this fear.At this moment, the air-conditioning of the theatre suddenly lowered the temperature very low for some unknown reason, the cold wind passing by slightly, and the silent and dark environment.Driven by instinct, Xia Xueqi’s body subconsciously came close to Su Mingyuan’s body, the only companion around her, the only warm place.The two of them had their legs next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, Xia Xueqi’s tall plump breasts were also close to his arms, making him want to move and feel the soft warmth.All of this was naturally caused by Su Mingyuan’s deliberate arrangement, two hours of film, two hours of such intimate and non-distance contact.No matter how much Xia Xueqi liked him in her heart, her body, her subconscious, must not reject close contact with him.If there were some good things that made people blush and increase heartbeat in the process, maybe this rejection would turn into liking, or even addiction?Feeling Xia Xueqi’s soft and jade-like body, he quietly stretched out his arm and first placed it lightly on her shoulder.Xia Xueqi’s body trembled very slightly, but she didn’t react violently, and she didn’t sayanything.Even because he pulled out his arm, there was a gap between the two, and her body couldn’t help but lean tightly into his arms.Done!Su Mingyuan was instantly overjoyed, and the palm on her shoulder began to slide down slowly, passing over her arm, passing over her plump and strong towering, and finally landed on her tightly clasped waist.When his fingers brushed lightly across her mountains, Su Mingyuan felt the tender body in his arms tremble slightly again, and the corners of his mouth rose silently.In such a dark and silent environment, the rest of the perceptual and tactile sensations were amplified.In other words, in such an environment, Xueqi had become more sensitive…Now, he had completely embraced her in his arms,And the system didn’t even prompt to deduct the villain point.He was not only attacking Xia Xueqi, but also testing the system’s boundary for violation of this definition.It was Xia Xueqi who took the initiative to lean against his arms, so he just put his hand on her waist, which was not considered an infringement, right?Just like he had already tried it out in the kiss with Ruoruo before, when Ruoruo took the initiative to kiss him, even if the two briefly separated their lips, he kissed back, and he was not deducted from the villain points.Because if Ruoruo had already kissed him on his own initiative, then his kiss back was no longer considered a violation.Su Mingyuan couldn’t help but imagine that one day, if he was in bed with Ruoruo, Hongxue or Xueqi…Even if he had to be passive for the first time because of the rules, he could only be pushed back.But since he had already been pushed back by the heroine, if he pushed back, it shouldn’t be said to be a violation, and it won’t deduct the villain points, right?Because according to the truth, the person who was violated was me!After all, Su Mingyuan wanted to stay on top of his conquest. As a big man, he could barely endure the humiliation of being pushed back once, but if he could only be pushed back again and again in bed in the future…Sorry, he couldn’t accept this!At this point, the movie finally started playing on the big screen.Su Mingyuan hugged Xia Xueqi’s slender waist, feeling her warmth and fragrance of her close proximity, and watched the movie.#pleasereadthischapteratwodernovels.comOn the other hand, Xiao Ran was still working hard to rescue the old lady who had a heart attack and give her artificial respiration.Then he got into the car with the emergency ambulance and took the old lady to the hospital.He had a clear premonition in his heart that the old lady he rescued this time would bring him great luck!
