If Su Mingyuan knew about Xiao Ran’s thoughts at this time, he would definitely not help but add in his heart.You are my son, and the most important protagonist who can get me a lot of villain points? If I am not good to you then who?You idiot can have a snack!Don’t let your dad down!He stuffed the snake-shaped spiritual jade into Xiao Ran’s hands, just trying to encourage him to cheer up.At this moment, he suddenly had a flash of inspiration, and blurted out, “It’s a coincidence that I happened to meet your sister Xiao Ruoruo when I sneaked into Su Mingyuan’s villa last night. If it wasn’t for her help, I wouldn’t have been able to get this piece of spiritual jade so easily.”“Senior brother, accept it. With this piece of spiritual jade, your skills will definitely improve a lot.”Su Mingyuan suddenly thought that Ruoruo had been an undercover agent with him for several days, but she didn’t seem to have done anything except to report to Xiao Ran twice.What if Xiao Ran suddenly felt that Ruoruo as an undercover agent was not a good idea, what should he do if she wanted to go back?This will not work!So he had an idea and he hurriedly added Ruoruo’s credit to this incident, just to give Xiao Ran a hint.If she was very useful as an undercover agent with Su Mingyuan, he wouldn’t even think about bringing her back.As soon as these words came out, Xiao Ran’s eyes turned red with emotion.He solemnly took Spiritual Jade, and carefully put away the gift from his junior brother and Ruoruo.Although the man didn’t cry easily, he couldn’t help but move to tears in his heart at this time, and at the same time, there was a hint of pride and disdain for Su Mingyuan.In this world, as expected, only Junior Brother and Ruoruo really treat me well…Humph, Su Mingyuan, can’t you think of it?You humiliated me like that last night, and the jade you took away from me was stolen by my junior brother and Ruoruo in an instant and returned to me.You still get nothing in the end!Hahaha, I really want to see what Junior Brother said with my own eyes. You will look so angry when you find out that jade is stolen.At this time, Su Mingyuan was too lazy to look at Xiao Ran’s expression, which was at the brink of tearing up, but also showed a hint of pride and contempt.With that expression and appearance, those who didn’t know thought that Xiao Ran was a naughty child who felt that he had succeeded in winning the favour after being taken care of by adults.He didn’t care whether Xiao Ran was moved or not, he just wanted to know why Xiao Ran became like that last night.That was what he cared about the most!Whether Xiao Ran’s personality had changed or not, this was what he was most worried about!So he pretended to be concerned and a little puzzled, and quickly asked, “Senior brother, I heard about what happened last night. You obviously have great luck and your character is firm and unyielding. Why did you choose to apologise to Su Mingyuan last night?”“I went back last night and tried to figure it out. I can’t resist the interference of the heavens. I only felt that your behaviour was secretly fueled by someone, but I don’t know the real reason.”Su Mingyuan’s expression was entangled and embarrassed, as if he was really a master of divine fortune-telling, but he was confused and embarrassed by the interference of heaven’s secrets when he was doing fortune-telling.In fact, he would be considered a fart, he was just talking nonsense and setting up a person in front of Xiao Ran.Anyway, he believed that if it wasn’t for someone or something, Xiao Ran would never have acted like last night!Xiao Ran really did not suspect him, and in the face of his doubts, he honestly told him the reason behind it.It was the Su and Xia family and Murong Hongxue who put pressure on him from behind, and he had no choice but to do this. Otherwise, he would not be able to move an inch in China, and he would not even be able to take the first step of his revenge plan.Forbearance for a while was for better development in the future!After listening to this explanation, Su Mingyuan suddenly realised that he found the real instigator behind the scenes.Good!It turns out that you, Murong Hongxue, are behind the scenes!I knew that Xiao Ran would not suddenly surrender to me and admit his mistake for no reason. I knew him well.He breathed a sigh of relief.This meant that Xiao Ran had not changed, he was still the unyielding protagonist Mingyuan was familiar with.But then he was a little annoyed in his heart.I’ve been looking for you as a white knight. On the night of the performance, I sent my fiancee Xia Xueqi and my sister Su Xuelan to hold you back.I didn’t expect that you, Murong Hongxue, would still succeed in destroying a wave of my good deeds behind the scenes!Of course, Su Mingyuan knew that Murong Hongxue couldn’t be blamed for this, she might have just followed the trend.Mainly because this week, Xiao Ran was even more arrogant after gaining the upper hand.That night at the Blue Rose Bar, he was so arrogant that he openly said sarcastic words that offended the Su Xia family at the same time.No wonder he brought it for himself.But it’s okay for him to suffer, but, I, the father, has also suffered.It’s really too unsatisfactory, too incompetent, too unpromising!Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan couldn’t help but give Xiao Ran an angry look, but it made Xiao Ran a little baffled.“Senior brother, what’s wrong?”“It’s nothing, it’s just Senior Brother, since Spiritual Jade has been delivered, it’s time for me to leave. As a half member of the Xuanmen, I still try not to involve too much cause and effect. Senior Brother, I’m leaving, goodbye, we will meet later!”Xiao Ran originally wanted to open his mouth and request him to stay, but after hearing these words, he could only move his mouth silently, waved his hand, and bid farewell to this mysterious junior brother.Junior Brother had done enough for him, how could he have the nerve to keep him and let him get more karmic karma in this world?Xiao Ran understood this.So in the end, he could only silently watch the back of his younger brother disappear at the end of the long street for a long, long time.He silently turned and left.And Su Mingyuan had just left, and as soon as he returned to the company building, Xia Xueqi came.Like Murong Hongxue, she missed the chance to meet Su Mingyuan perfectly.This time she came, naturally, to discuss with Xiao Ran about jointly opening a film and television company.Now that she knew that according to the plot, in addition to opening this security company, Xiao Ran would also use a lot of banknotes to develop into the film and television industry, and rely on the energy of this circle to gradually grasp the power of public opinion in the future. So, she naturally wanted a piece of the pie.No, to be precise, she was Xiao Ran’s partner on the surface who would assist him, and take her share when the cake would be bigger.In fact, it was Xiao Ran’s film and television company. The future power in the film and television industry would be in her hands.After all, Xiao Ran was only one person. He needed a lot of manpower to start a company and make contacts to form a network of influence.#PLEASEREADTHISCHAPTERATWONDERNOVELS.COMThat being the case, Xia Xueqi would help him and provide him with manpower, Xiao Ran only needed to be responsible for giving money.Using Xiao Ran’s funds and luck to help her develop her company and power, she would then gain everything. This was her plan.And Xiao Ran obviously couldn’t see through this scheme.Because now in his heart, apart from Ruoruo and Junior Brother, the most trustworthy person was of course Xia Xueqi, who had been silently supporting him and believing in him.If Xia Xueqi took care of the film and television company, he wouldn’t worry!“Boss, Miss Xia is here.”“Please!”
