Su Mingyuan hammered his head, and explained to himself in his heart: Ah, I must have not slept well last night, and something went wrong with my brain, so hurry up and rest against Ruoruo’s thigh to recover.Su Mingyuan rested on Ruoruo’s white silk encompassed thighs for a few hours.When he woke up, he was full of energy.Finally, the good news came from Su Li.Yesterday evening, when Xiao Ran, who was in a depressed mood, went out for a walk, he happened to meet the owner of the mysterious ancient jade, the down to earth son of a wealthy family.The guy was in a bit of trouble at the time, but Xiao Ran helped him to solve it. Then the two stopped and chatted, talking about their recent depression and suffering, and it was a kind of late meeting.In short, after hearing this report, Su Mingyuan knew that everything was stable.Now, director Su had eliminated all risks, arranged all the actors, and prepared all the logistics, so he couldn’t put on a good show according to his script and the plot of the original novel?He, Su Mingyuan, would never believe it!In this performance, it was impossible for any problems to arise. It was even more impossible for the characters to enter in disorder like the previous three times!Tonight, it would be his one-man show with Xiao Ran!It was also the first important pavement that he had acquired a lot of villain points, and successfully laid the groundwork for getting excellent and above evaluations in every performance in the future!Oh, the ridiculous evaluation of passing and failing could no longer appear in Su Mingyuan’s dictionary.200 villain points? 400 villain points?With the careful preparation by Director Su, everything had been completely brought into his control.In this show, Su Mingyuan was just playing it in a bad way tonight. At least, he could get a good rating or more casually, and get more than seven or eight hundred Villain Points, right?Not to mention that after bringing Ruoruo, this evaluation had to go up by one, so the value of the Villain Points in his hands should have to go up by one or two hundred more?At night, Hongyun Building was brightly lit.Xiao Ran learned two days ago that an exhibition would be held here to display all kinds of precious and cherished antiques.And after he accidentally rescued the man named Zhao Liteng yesterday, he realised that the mysterious ancient jade that attracted everyone’s attention at this exhibition was actually the treasure of Zhao Liteng’s family!And from his mouth, he also knew that this ancient snake-shaped jade not only made people feel relaxed and happy when looking at it, but also made people feel clear-headed, quick-witted when worn on the body.Hearing this, Xiao Ran, who originally planned to go to the exhibition to try his luck, didn’t know that this treasure of Zhao Liteng’s family was a real spiritual jade!It was a rare spiritual jade that could really help him improve his skills and greatly purify and refine his true energy!He didn’t expect to return to the country for a few days and receive these surprises. Although he felt a little wronged, he found two spiritual jades so quickly!One was worn on Su Mingyuan’s waist, and Ruoruo would steal it for him in the future.One was about to be auctioned at the exhibition in Hongyun Building, and the one with the highest price would win!Xiao Ran would definitely not miss this opportunity!This snake-shaped spiritual jade, he would take it!And what made him even more happy was that it might be because of his help, or it might be because they hit it off.Zhao Liteng said that he really needed money urgently now, but if someone competed with Xiao Ran at the exhibition, as long as Xiao Ran’s bid was not too low, he would give priority to selling this ancient jade to him.Steady!It was stable now!Xiao Ran was full of confidence.He was not short of money, and now there was a guarantee from the owner of the lot. Hasn’t Xiao Ran already won this Spiritual Jade?At this moment, the familiar feeling seemed to come back.He just saw that someone was in trouble when he was in a bad mood, so he did a favour and vented his emotions. As a result, he accidentally met Zhao Liteng, the owner of Spiritual Jade.He just talked to him for a few words, and the two hit it off. Zhao Liteng also promised to sell Spiritual Jade to him first.He had had so many experiences like this in the past.An inconspicuous little thing done casually would suddenly bring him huge gains.In fact, after returning to China, he was not without such an experience.For example, as soon as he returned to China, he encountered a robber who robbed in public, but was stopped by him. Through this, he met the Eldest Miss Xia family and Xia Xueqi, the president of Xuanmei Company, and successfully entered the upper circle with her contacts. Also won her heart.Another example was when he passed by Yanming Mountain a few days ago and saw a group of young people racing, he couldn’t help showing a slight contempt for those people’s driving skills, and then he was seen.#pleasereadthischapteratfanstranslation.comAfter some talk, he was instigated to make a gesture on the court, but as a result of a casual little trick, which aroused the amazement of everyone, and also gained the friendship of Ye Chen, the second young master of the Ye family.And some time ago, he saw two old men in the park playing chess there every day, so he couldn’t help but go over to give some pointers, and win their heart.Although it was not clear what substantial benefits this trivial matter would bring him for the time being, he always felt that having a good relationship with these two old men would bring him great benefits.He believed in this kind of hunch, the old Taoist said that he was a person of great luck, and this hunch had been fulfilled, so whenever such an inexplicable induction occurs, he would do it.If it wasn’t for Su Mingyuan enraging him in succession every time he met him, Xiao Ran would have really felt that the familiar feeling would have returned long ago.But now, instead of recalling how much he was angry with Su Mingyuan, winning that spiritual jade was his top priority tonight!At the gate of the Hongyun Building, Xiao Ran paid an entry fee of 60,000 yuan and stepped into the building.At this moment, a roar of the engine came from far. When the Rolls-Royce with a unique shape in the world stopped at the entrance of Hongyun Building, everyone knew who was coming.The eldest of the Su family, Su Mingyuan!Xiao Ran suddenly trembled, and his heartbeat rose up.Yes, why didn’t he expect that Su Mingyuan was also famous in Mingjing as a person who liked beautiful jade. He learned that a mysterious ancient jade would be exhibited in the Hongyun Building tonight. How could he not come?The two bodyguards wearing suits and sunglasses filled with murderous aura first got out of the car and opened the door respectfully.Afterwards, a slender and beautiful white silk thigh gracefully stretched out from the car door.As soon as Xiao Ruoruo in a white dress appeared in everyone’s eyes, they instantly focused all eyes on her.With an angelic face and pure and holy temperament, everyone present seemed to see a real angel at this moment.And this angel was bowing slightly at the moment, extending her slender hand to greet the real owner of this luxury car.Su Mingyuan, dressed in a delicate and elegant tuxedo appeared imposingly.He was already very handsome, and if one ignored his usual playful ways, once he got serious, he would naturally look extraordinarily temperamental, which was in line with people’s perfect imagination of the upper class aristocracy.At the gate of Hongyun Building at this time, Xiao Ran, who saw this scene, clenched his teeth and his eyes were full of resentment.Even if he knew that Ruoruo was acting, but seeing how she respected and obeyed Su Mingyuan, and heard the praise of Su Mingyuan from the people next to him; there were even people who said that this pair of men and women were really a good match, his anger was unstoppable.#pleasereadthischapteratfanstranslation.comThe grievances he suffered these days, the invisible oppression and threats made him even more angry and hatred burned in his eyes.However he couldn’t flare out.He had to bear his grievances for big plans, because the ancients who achieved great things, not only have extraordinary talents, but also must have perseverance.He had to hold back!At this moment, he remembered the conditions made by Murong Hongxue, and the request from the Su and Xia family to forgive him after Xia Xueqi worked hard for him…To be here, in front of everyone, in front of Ruoruo, to apologise to Su Mingyuan…?Xiao Ran’s fists kept clenching and loosening.
