Outside the door, Xia Xueqi, as always, maintained the iceberg beauty expression, appearing cold and indifferent.It wasn’t until the moment she walked in and saw Xiao Ran that the corners of her mouth were slightly raised by a few tenths of a centimetre, revealing a very faint smile.However, just the smile of this slightly rising beauty made Xiao Ran fascinated.I have to endure the nausea and act again…Xia Xueqi forcibly endured her inner discomfort, thinking:When this meeting is over, I must find an excuse to make an appointment with Mingyuan. If I don’t replenish Mingyuan’s energy in time, I will suffer for a whole day!However, she didn’t know that if she had come a step earlier, she would have been able to see the limited edition version of Su Mingyun with her own eyes.Not to mention that because of Xiao Ran’s previous explanation, Su Mingyuan had an opinion on Murong Hongxue.He was now ready to run to Murong Hongxue to ask for an explanation!Hey, little girl, I revealed so much information to you that day, and told you that with Xiao Ran’s strength, as long as you form an alliance with him, he can help you fulfil your dream of revenge on the Murong family.Why do you still treat me like this? Is that how you allied with him?Didn’t you see that he was about to be oppressed by you into a completely useless waste!Su Mingyuan was so angry.If Xiao Ran really fell into disrepair and changed from unyielding to submissive, what would happen to his future performances?Then, could he still earn villain Points?That was really the end of the game!Murong Hongxue was a variable, he must find a way to teach her today, and he must not let her do some tricks behind his back in the future.Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan immediately went to Lingxue Pavilion where Murong Hongxue was.To be able to have a Chinese classical garden as a residence in a place like Ming city  where every inch of land was so precious, the identity of its owner was naturally unusual.Lingxue Pavilion was one of Murong Hongxue’s permanent residences.After talking with Xiao Ran, she returned here, came to the study, and looked at the word “Quiet” left by Su Mingyuan before. The sadness and melancholy in her heart could not stop rising.This word had been completely framed and hung by her, so she could appreciate it from time to time.But every time she saw this character, whenever she saw the simple, natural and charming “Quiet” character, she couldn’t calm down.Because she hasn’t seen him for a long time since she said goodbye to him last time.She asked him out twice as a young lady, but was always interrupted by other damn women.I also had to contact Xiao Ran for the overall situation, and in the future, I would slowly pretend that our relationship has improved after the number of cooperation has increased.Only in this way could Xiao Ran’s security company be completely infiltrated by her hands.Just thinking of these conspiracies and calculations, and how she didn’t have a date with Su Mingyuan, and didn’t have physical contact with him, Murong Hongxue felt very annoyed, depressed, and melancholic.And whenever she had this kind of need to vent her emotions, it was either some lawbreakers in the underground world of this city would suffer soon.Or, she would write a pair of words with a pen and ink to express her feelings.However, if this still failed to calm her down a little, then some criminals in the underground world would probably suffer soon.Murong Hongxue walked to the book desk, remembered the two requests she had been unable to get, and suddenly a poem she had read came to her mind, so she waved and wrote down the words:Thinking of you every day, but not seeing you, feels as if the wheel of time is unbearable.Just when she wrote this sentence, when the ink was still dry.Clap!Applause suddenly sounded in the room.Su Mingyuan, dressed in white, appeared in the room at an unknown time. Looking at the words Murong Hongxue had just written, he said with admiration, “Good poetry, good poetry, good calligraphy, good calligraphy, I didn’t expect that after the last farewell, Miss Murong, your calligraphy skills have reached a new level in such a short period of time.”“Miss Murong, I didn’t expect you, an underground queen who kills people without blinking an eye, to write such a sentence when she is alone. The thoughtful poem, and between the lines, his lovesickness is vividly displayed.”He looked at Murong Hongxue and asked curiously, “How could a femme fatale like you actually fall in love with a man? Moreover, you used this love sickness to temporarily improve your calligraphy?”The way he appeared on the stage like a hero, his careless tone, the word pretend almost materialized on his face.But he also had something to say.What?On weekdays, I have to play the villain, and I can only watch others pretend to be heroes. Moreover, I have to become  Xiao Ran’s target for face slapping , and watch him pretend.Now that I’m a white knight, can’t I just relax?Besides, in terms of real strength, even if I immediately spend the enhancement points to temporarily buy a one-day experience card for 20 years of skill, I am not necessarily a match for Murong Hongxue.If I don’t have to appear in this way, if I don’t pretend, how can I calm her down?“Miss Murong, I already reminded you last time, but it seems that your security and defence are still not well done.”He said lightly in that pretentious tone, just to reflect an unfathomable style.Who knew that Murong Hongxue’s next sentence would almost break him.“Of course I did as you reminded me last time, and I specifically instructed my subordinates ”What!How could this be!Su Mingyuan almost couldn’t hold back the expression on his face, but fortunately he reacted wisely and immediately remedied, “Of course I can see this. Your subordinates might have leakage in defence. I would suggest you tell them to block the leakage. That’s why I remind you again to strengthen your defence.”Murong Hongxue didn’t answer. She just looked at him with a smile, staring into his eyes. Seeing that Su Mingyuan couldn’t help feeling a little flustered, he almost broke the character of an expert, and blurted out, “Why don’t you speak?”Fortunately, he wisely held back.Let’s not talk and pretend to be a master.You don’t speak, and I don’t speak!The two stared at each other quietly like this, Su Mingyuan tried hard not to let his eyes escape from a guilty conscience, and he appeared to be full of profound wisdom.However, Murong Hongxue’s eyes became more and more gentle, and her affection burned like a fire.Then, the smile on her face became more and more beautiful and charming, like a peony that suddenly bloomed.“Knight, you just mentioned the poem I wrote and the word I wrote. Do you know who I wrote this poem and this word for?”She looked at Su Mingyuan with a pair of limpid eyes, flickering with waves of affection.***
