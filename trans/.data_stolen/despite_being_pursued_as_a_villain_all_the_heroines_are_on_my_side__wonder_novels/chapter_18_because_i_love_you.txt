After hanging up, Xiao Ran already believed Xiao Ruoruo’s words.After all, this was the younger sister who grew up with him, and if he didn’t believe her, there was no one in this world that could be trusted by him.At the same time, all the content of this conversation was perfectly conveyed to Su Mingyuan’s ears in the monitoring room through monitoring.“So…that’s it!”“To steal my jade pendant and be Xiao Ran’s undercover agent to secretly pass on information to him. It turns out that Xiao Ruoruo has such a motive!”Su Mingyuan waved his fist excitedly.Through this secret monitoring, he finally understood what kind of wishful thinking Xiao Ruoruo had.He finally got a glimpse of Xiao Ruoruo’s intentions!But he wasn’t happy for long, and calmed down immediately.“But… there are a lot of things that don’t make sense.”Su Mingyuan thought of a series of sugar-coated bombs delivered to his door by Xiao Ruoruo, held his chin, and fell into deep thought: “If you are an undercover agent… Do you need to sacrifice yourself like this?”‘Kissing me, make such an outrageous agreement with myself, and give me a knee pillow massage…’“Also, in the conversation just now, Xiao Ruoruo lied to Xiao Ran that I was impotent to reassure him, this is…why?“Could it be… that this wasn’t her true intention? Or… she would rather sacrifice her beauty in order to target me, Xiao Ran’s enemy, and to pass on information to Xiao Ran?”“And she clearly knew that Xiao Ran definitely didn’t want her to sacrifice herself, so she lied about me being impotent, so that Xiao Ran could feel at ease?”Even so, Su Mingyuan was still a little confused.To say that Xiao Ruoruo sacrificed herself in order to be Xiao Ran’s undercover agent… He always felt that this reason was a bit far-fetched.But other than that, he really couldn’t think of any other reason.“It doesn’t matter, if you can’t figure it out, try again.”“Just in time, I’m going to Xuanmei Company tomorrow to target Xiao Ran and start my second performance. Then I’ll tell her the news later to see if she will secretly remind Xiao Ran.”At that time, it would be clear at a glance whether Xiao Ruoruo was Xiao Ran’s undercover agent!After making a plan, Su Mingyuan immediately prepared to execute it.He was such a resolute man.He first asked the servants in the villa to prepare lunch, and then came to Xiao Ruoruo’s room and knocked on the door.“Ruoruo, would you like to have lunch with me?”The door opened revealing Xiao Ruoruo’s pretty smiling face, “Okay.”In the luxuriously decorated restaurant, the long table was full of exquisite meals. Each dish on the table was made of top-quality ingredients, carefully cooked and placed by the most professional chef, and made into fragrant and decorative dishes. They looked exquisite.They were both delicious and artistic, like pieces of art in a museum, waiting for people to appreciate and taste. The luxury and connotation of a wealthy family could also be seen in this small place.However, Su Mingyuan’s intention to ask Xiao Ruoruo to have lunch was obviously not to show her how rich and meaningful his family was.The whole long table was large enough to accommodate twenty people, but Xiao Ruoruo chose to sit beside Su Mingyuan alone.“Brother Mingyuan, do you need me to serve you a meal?” She smiled brightly.Su Mingyuan shook his head and refused: “No need.”“By the way, Ruoruo, there’s something I’ve always wondered about, can you help me answer it?”“What’s up?”Su Mingyuan turned to face her, looked into her eyes and asked, “Why are you so… enthusiastic about me?”“You are my boss and I am your secretary, shouldn’t I be warm to you?” Xiao Ruoruo asked back with a smile.“You know what I want to hear, not this vague answer, Xiao Ruoruo.”Su Mingyuan narrowed his eyes slightly, stared at her with a scrutiny, and began to put pressure on her:“I have checked your information. You are very beautiful, but you never thought to exchange your beauty for anything. Even though life was very difficult since you were a child, you have always kept yourself clean and not tempted by money. But today, you didn’t show any struggle to throw yourself into my arms, kiss me actively, and provide me with knee pillow and massage services when I’m tired…”“It’s abnormal, it’s very different from your usual behaviour, Xiao Ruoruo, can you tell me why?”In the face of Su Mingyuan’s questioning and his stern appearance, Xiao Ruoruo smiled and stared at his face affectionately, with strange sparkles in his eyes.“Why? Because I… like you, brother Mingyuan.”She said this in a soft voice, without trembling, but it took a lifetime of courage.At this moment, Su Mingyuan suddenly burst out laughing:“Hahaha! Ruoruo, I never thought you would give such a reason, I believe it, I really believe it!”He said that he believed it, but the smile in his tone and the corners of his mouth raised undoubtedly proved that in his eyes, Xiao Ruoruo’s words were such a clumsy and ridiculous excuse!‘Xiao Ruoruo, did you say you like me?’‘Hahaha, this is literally the funniest joke I’ve heard today!’‘You are the female protagonist in “Urban Supremacy Emperor“. You are Xiao Ran’s most trusted and closest sister. You grew up with him, respected him and admired him.’‘As a result, you now come to me, meet me for the first time today, and say, you like me?Saying that you fell in love with the villain you hate at first sight?’‘Hahaha, how is this possible!’‘Xiao Ruoruo, you think I’m a fool, so easy to deceive!’Seeing Su Mingyuan smiling so happily, Xiao Ruoruo lowered her head, the smile on the corner of her mouth faded bitterly, and her eyes suddenly dimmed.Knowing that she said such a thing at this time, it was very likely that she would be misunderstood by brother Mingyuan and regarded as a joke by him.But she still couldn’t help but muster the courage to speak.She was clearly prepared to be laughed at, but when she really saw that he felt that her confession to him was just a ridiculous excuse and laughed because of it.‘My heart…why are you so sad?’How many sincere words were said inadvertently, but they were ignored as a joke.She wiped the corners of her eyes, raised her head, and smiled at Su Mingyuan.“Brother Mingyuan, I just… I was really joking.”Su Mingyuan immediately put away his smile, looked at her and asked, “Then what is your real purpose?”“My real purpose…”“Brother Mingyuan, everyone has some little secrets. As long as you know, I definitely didn’t stay by your side to harm you, that’s fine.”Xiao Ruoruo didn’t dare to tell him all the truth.In the previous life, Big sister Lan and the others speculated that the so-called will of the world might be like a robot with a programmed program. It would only execute commands strictly according to the program.Otherwise, when he awakened these female protagonists, the heavens descended and killed them. How could he just sit back and watch them unite against Xiao Ran?He might not be able to obliterate the native creatures of this world at will, and could only use various means of interference with luck to affect the operation of the world.#pleasereadthischapteratWONDERNOVELS.COMBecause in the future, he just blindly strengthened Xiao Ran’s luck to try to keep him alive, without letting Xiao Ran’s strength suddenly skyrocket to the level of a god, and he didn’t kill them backhand as punishment after they killed Xiao Ran..Even at the moment of killing Xiao Ran, they felt the shadow of that will shrouding their heads, and the damned will of the world was also destroyed because of Xiao Ran’s death.The so-called will of the world might be in a symbiosis with Xiao Ran, trying to make the whole world evolve and develop with Xiao Ran as the protagonist.So he needed brother Mingyuan to play the villain to continue the development of the plot.Then as long as brother Mingyuan was still acting according to his will, he would not kill brother Mingyuan.But if Brother Mingyuan were to know the identity of her rebirth and the truth of everything.In the eyes of World Will, he would become an accomplice trying to kill Xiao Ran.#pleasereadthischapteratWONDERNOVELS.COMAs the main culprits, because of the identity of the native creatures and the heroine of the novel, the will of the world couldn’t kill her.But brother Mingyuan, an unprotected visitor from another world, would surely be mercilessly obliterated by it.Therefore, Brother Mingyuan must not be allowed to know the truth of everything and that he was reborn!In the face of Su Mingyuan’s questioning, Xiao Ruoruo could only choose to avoid talking about it, she really couldn’t tell him the reason for everything.But her silence and concealment left a deep rift in Su Mingyuan’s heart.[ADVANCED CHAPTERS: CLICK HERE]Special thanks to:Verv,sabj00,Somedude,Tennou Kazami,Alex Fallen,Sean N,Carlos morelos,Avarco,light knight,RoyalReaper77,Fastus,Wei Xelphius,I, Your Father,tspic,Aiden Elliott,Sham Knight,Sham Knight,Mervin Chong,Israel negrete,john,Marc Malonzo,Yorume,Louis Jacquet,NOPE YOU DON’T KNOW MY NAME,FondleMyBalls,Bob Oakley, WOWTHATSSOCOOL,UncleTerri,Riot, Pyronis,Will,mick2042, Will,BobTheLost,josh franzen ❤❤❤
