Although Xiao Ran hated Su Mingyuan very much, looked down on him, and was very reluctant to apologise to such a bastard as him.But for the sake of the overall situation and the hard work of Xueqi, he had actually slowly convinced himself in his heart that he would find a time, an opportunity and a place to surrender to Su Mingyuan once.But he was not ready, he had not completely let go of his dignity and face, he needed a period of time to slowly adjust his mentality, and he had not even prepared for the heavy gift of apology…But he didn’t expect him to be here, and unexpectedly met Su Mingyuan again!And looking at the timings, Su Mingyuan was obviously here for the Spiritual Jade.What to do……Do I really have to apologise to Su Mingyuan here?But he wasn’t ready for his gift yet. Should he take a picture of the Spiritual Jade himself and give it to Su Mingyuan as an apology gift?Such a humiliating thing… letting me… go and bow down to Su Mingyuan…“Yo, isn’t this the ungrateful white-eyed wolf Xiao Ran, what is he doing at the door, is it that he can’t pay the entry fee?”At this moment, Su Mingyuan brought Xiao Ruoruo towards the door, and the two happened to bump into each other.“If you can’t pay the entry fee, tell me, I am in a good mood today. As long as you bark like a dog, maybe I will let you go in and pay homage to the upper class. What about the opportunities in the circle?”Su Mingyuan successfully angered Xiao Ran with only two sentences.Xiao Ran was so provoked by him, how could he still think of apologising? Now he couldn’t wait to smash Su Mingyuan’s wickedly smiling face with one fist!At this moment, Ruoruo, who was standing behind Su Mingyuan, cast a worried look at him. She shook her head slightly, signalling him not to conflict with Su Mingyuan on this occasion.Xiao Ran held back his anger, gave Su Mingyuan a vicious look, turned around, and rushed into the building angrily.If he didn’t leave, he was afraid that he would not be able to restrain his anger, and punch Su Mingyuan on the spot!Tolerate?Endure what?After the big deal, he would apologise to Su Mingyuan.But today, in front of Ruoruo, he would never bow to Su Mingyuan!He was bound to get that Spiritual Jade. It was absolutely impossible for him to give it to Su Mingyuan!Looking at Xiao Ran’s red eyes before he left, the corners of Su Mingyuan’s mouth turned up slightly.Good, that’s the look.My son, I knew you would not let me down.Continue to maintain such anger and hatred and slap me in the face tonight!For you, I have eliminated all difficulties, and built a perfect stage.How far you can go, and whether you can pretend to be a big one in front of the audience tonight, depends on your own performance!I believe you!At this moment, Su Mingyuan was so confident and high-spirited.When he stepped into the door of the Hongyun Building with his left foot and heard the sound of the system in his ear, he even felt an unusual pleasure and relaxation.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comWhen there was no longer any interference, he just needed to do his own job as an actor and cooperate with the protagonist Xiao Ran to complete a wonderful protagonist pretending to act, could he not feel relaxed and happy?【Beep! To trigger the plot, please complete the performance according to the villain and the plot of the original novel.】【After the performance, according to the evaluation level, you will get 200~1800 villain points and the same strengthening points.】1800 points.Compared with the last time, the villain points of this perfect evaluation is a bit less.What a pity.Su Mingyuan smacked his lips, a little disappointed.Originally, he wanted to use all his firepower, get a perfect evaluation, and get a lot of villain points in one fell swoop, but when he saw that he could only get a maximum of 1800 points, his high interest suddenly dropped.But he didn’t want to feel bad, and cherished every opportunity to perform.After all, as the number of female protagonists who appeared later increases, the variables and risks would also increase. He might not be able to eliminate all interference in advance like today.Thinking that in order to achieve today’s situation, he had to accompany Xia Xueqi on a date, and he had to act coquettishly to his sister, letting them both drag Murong Hongxue…Thinking of it this way, it would be nice if each of them were as obedient as Ruoruo.Otherwise, before every performance in the future, I have to find a way to exclude them from the set.The most terrifying thing was in the kind of plot scene that required them to appear. For example, in the next performance, in addition to Xiao Ran, the two female protagonists Liu Mengning and Xia Xueqi would appear in the plot.It would take a lot of work to get them all to cooperate with him and Xiao Ran to act according to the director’s arrangement!Thinking about it again… Maybe Xia Xueqi’s second strategy before would have a good effect instead?Because the Overlord had collapsed even more seriously, the female protagonists would not take the initiative to like Xiao Ran anymore.Unlike the previous week, he did so much for them. When he mentioned “I am Xiao Ran’s boss”, all the good feelings he had gained were transferred to Xiao Ran.That being the case…If he let them all fall in love with him, and let them play with him in the future, could they still not agree?In the future, he still needed to rack his brains and try to make deals with them before every performance so that they could act according to my plan?At that time, they seemed to have a certain relationship with Xiao Ran on the surface. In fact, they would not let him eat even the slightest benefit.Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan suddenly became excited.But then, he suddenly woke up and expelled his fantasy of the Arabian Nights from his mind.What am I dreaming about?Let all these female protagonits fall in love with me with all their hearts? How is this possible!I am not Xiao Ran, the son of destiny, the protagonist of the world. Without the halo of the protagonist and the halo of wisdom, how could it be possible for all these female protagonists to fall in love with me?#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBesides, even if they fall in love with me, when women’s jealousy and dominance flare up, it’s fine if they don’t fight inside first, and they still listen to my words and perform with me?However, this plan is not impossible.At least for now, Ruoruo and her elder sister are already his capable and obedient assistants. On Xia Xueqi’s side, since she has changed her outlook on himself, maybe he can win her by fighting for her?***
