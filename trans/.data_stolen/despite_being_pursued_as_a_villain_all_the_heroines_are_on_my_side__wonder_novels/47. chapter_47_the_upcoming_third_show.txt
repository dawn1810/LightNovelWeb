Xiao Ran left with proud and unrestrained strides.Being able to perform in front of Xia Xueqi really made him happy.Xia Chengquan had also been untied, and at that moment, was obediently standing behind Xia Xueqi awaiting orders.When Xiao Ran left, only then did Xia Xueqi slowly relaxed her clenched left fist.The palm wound that was healed by Mingyu’s True Qi opened up again.This really is…Disgusting.She looked back at Xia Chengquan.When the middle-aged man made contact with her cold eyes, he no longer bore any resemblance to a proud elder, but instead was trembling in fear.When one could easily inflict pain or death on another person, their fear of you could easily be used to control them.The Life and Death Mark.This was the method used by the ancient masters of the Xiao Family to control other family members, enabling them to treat them like dogs.Back then, Xiao Ran’s parents could not bear their children’s fate of being controlled like slaves, so they resolutely left the Xiao Family.And now, with Xiao Ran having learned and grown powerful using the Mingyu Technique, he had also learned to use the mark to make other people his dogs.However, this kind of method…She could do it too.Who you’re able to get a hold on certain worldly treasures, and after quickly advancing in the Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine Technique up to a certain level, she could also place Life and Death Marks like Xiao Ran, and even replace them with her own.Essentially, Xia Chengquan wasn’t anyone’s dog but hers.As for the consequences of Ruoruo and Mingyuan doing such things with her present…Although she felt very unhappy, it wasn’t like she couldn’t bear it.To Mingyuan, being the villain must have been depressing, and Ruoruo might have just been a way for him to vent his feelings.Xiao Ran wasn’t dead yet, so her relationship with Mingyuan could only develop slowly.From her open hostility and disgust against him, to her gradually learning to appreciate and even liking him… this process was destined to be very long, so there would definitely be women that would try to steal him from her along the way.She could bear with it because she would have the last laugh in the end.She knew very well of the difference between a moment of pleasure and a lifetime of one.‘And after I’ve become Mingyuan’s wife, these bitches who’ve stolen Mingyuan for such a moment of pleasure…’‘Don’t even think about getting close to him again! Not even once!’…………In the mansion, in the study room, on the lounge chair…Su Mingyuan finally knew why so many people wanted to be the ‘Wang from next door*’.*Note: A term jokingly used to refer to a neighbor who is supposedly sleeping with your wife.‘Because this is really…’‘Super cool!’‘Ruoruo’s hands are simply… first-class!’‘When she held onto me while on the phone with Xiao Ran… doing two taboo acts at the same time made it so exciting!’Suffice to say, that almost made Su Mingyuan nut immediately, so he couldn’t help but go on a rampage on her as he pressed her on the desk.At that moment, even if he had to pay villain points, he’d still decide to…Fortunately, before he could make up his mind, Ruoruo jumped out of his arms and ran away red-faced, as she was too embarrassed to face him after the phone call.He could finally breathe a sigh of a relief as he took a sip of tea on his table to calm down.‘Su Mingyuan! Oh, Su Mingyuan! How could you fall so low?!’‘Think about the previous two failed performances! Have you figured out why you failed?’‘Have you found a way to prevent failing again?’‘You can’t even beat Xia Xueqi in a battle of strength! If you don’t have enough villain points to buy the True Qi bundles from the system store, why aren’t you practicing on your own?!’After his post-nut clarity, Su Mingyuan woke up completely.‘Yes. Now that the key information has been successfully conveyed to Xiao Ran by Ruoruo, it’s very likely that the twisted plot line will start going back on track.’So the next thing on his agenda should be his preparation for his third performance in a few days.After his first two performances, Su Mingyuan could already sum up the biggest reason for their failures.It definitely wasn’t because he had poor acting skills! The problem was the two heroines on the stage: Xiao Ruoruo and Xia Xueqi!However, his third show only included him and Xiao Ran having a bit of a scuffle at the Blue Rose Bar, which ends with him getting slapped in the face.‘As the two women weren’t involved, this time… he shouldn’t be failing, right?‘No! I shouldn’t be thinking like this!’Su Mingyuan slapped his cheek hard, and warned himself in his heart:Su Mingyuan slapped his cheek hard as he cautioned his heart: ‘Su Mingyuan, haven’t you learned your lesson yet?!’After previously experiencing the two heroines ruining everything and ultimately making him fail twice, it wouldn’t surprise him if something similar would happen again this time.‘You shouldn’t be careless!’‘That’s right! I shouldn’t assume that none of the two heroines wouldn’t get involved in the show and that everything would be smooth sailing!’‘This time, I must at least get an excellent score, even if I can’t get a perfect one!’‘So, let’s evaluate the specifics of this upcoming performance first.’‘I, Su Mingyuan, as a playboy disciple who likes to play with women, would go to the Blue Rose Bar a few days later and would run into Xiao Ran and his group of murderous mercenary friends just as they’ve returned from overseas after helping him.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe Blue Rose Bar not only had a bar and dance floor reserved for its rich patrons on the first floor, it also had a secret floor where pleasure-seeking rich kids, high-ranking officials and the like could enter..This special bar was opened by Murong Hongxue, the Underground Queen of Mingjing. Naturally, Su Mingyuan came to the secret floor to pick up beautiful women.Xiao Ran had come here not only to have his foreign friends relax in the bar, but also to visit the Underground Queen. After all, the security firm he was about to open was in the security business, so it was only a matter of time before he had to deal with the Underground Queen.But the two would run into each other on their way there.As the villain, Su Mingyuan would have naturally wanted to humiliate Xiao Ran, questioning his qualifications to be able to enter the dance party on the second floor.And right after, a recent friend of Xiao Ran, Ye Chen, a scion of one of the big four families, the Ye Family, will stand up for his friend and vouch for him to enter the second floor. He slaps me in the face, then and there.Su Mingyuan would get so angry that he bumps into a waitress as he was walking away and will get alcohol spilled all over him.His immediate reaction would be to demand compensation, and after realizing that the waitress was quite the beauty, he’d demand 200,000 yuan as recompense or that she accompany him for one night.The waitress was only a poor college student at the Ming City Film Academy. Even though her family wasn’t well off, and she had to work here to survive, that didn’t mean she was willing to sell herself.Harassed by the aggressive and nasty Young Master Su, the waitress looked so innocent and pitiful.Xiao Ran couldn’t bear to see it any longer and made a move.This naturally led to him getting his face beat again.In that way, Xiao Ran would have been able to show off his arrogance in front of the other scions present, and gained the appreciation of countless others, whereas, he, Su Mingyuan, would have already become another stepping stone for him again.The ending act would be when Su Mingyuan, unwilling to accept his losing to Xiao Ran, and trying to get back even a bit of his dignity through a display of power, would threaten to send a hundred ex-special forces to beat Xiao Ran up when he got back home.But just as he was about to exit the second floor, Xiao Ran’s tall mercenary friends from abroad would warn him off about doing anything stupid by staring at him murderously, which causes him to leave in fear.Even though she wasn’t present at the time, when Murong Hongxue heard of the happenings that night, she evaluated Xiao Ran highly, even though he wasn’t free from blame. This incident paved the road for their future cooperation.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe rescued waitress also angrily accused Su Mingyuan of being shameless when he tried to malign the reputation of the Xiao Family’s children by bringing up Xiao Ruoruo’s scandal.Together with the other helpers of Xiao Ran, they shaped the public’s opinion to complete nail Su Mingyuan to the pillar of shame of being a scumbag.After recalling all these details, Su Mingyuan now knew exactly how things were going to go.***
