The lonely figure was almost engulfed in darkness.The light and laughter behind me will no longer have anything to do with myself.The fun belongs to them, and I…“Xueqi, wait!”Su Mingyuan’s voice suddenly pulled her back from the edge of the cliff.She stopped, but did not turn around, for fear that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.But, her cold hand was held by someone in a firm grasp.The four slender fingers found themselves intertwined by strong fingers, leaving no gap.It was the warm palm of Su Mingyuan.At that time, he had already figured it out.Even if it takes more energy and effort to remedy the plot later, so what?Work is work, life is life.He wanted to go home, back to Earth, so it was important for him to do his job as an actor.But, work was not the whole of life, and he was not a cold machine that only rationally calculated gains and losses.It was not just when he was wearing a white knight suit that he could be himself.Whether putting on the mask or taking it off, he should follow the truest feelings in his heart.Work was important, acting was important, and getting Villain Points was important.But, reassuring himself was equally important to him.This week, Xia Xueqi didn’t do anything to hurt him, and even chose to back down in front of Liu Mengning for him.If he really let her go here, silently watching her leave.In his heart, he would feel guilty and uneasy.And if one thought about it on the bright side, there would be gains and losses. Although he had ruined his personality and image in front of Liu Mengning, this action would be a big plus for Xia Xueqi, and he was not at a loss.So, what am I still confused about?He stepped forward and grabbed Xia Xueqi’s hand, firmly, never letting go.“Xueqi, why are you leaving in such a hurry? The date isn’t over yet, and I remember I didn’t say you could leave.”Just a single word of retention almost made Xia Xueqi turn back and throwing herself into his arms.She was not so vulnerable.When she called Mingyuan the other night and was mocked by Su Xuelan, she was slightly angry.But, only today, and only today was different.Because, today was the first time Mingyuan took the initiative to ask her for a date, and it was the first time he took the initiative to attack her.Their afternoon and evening, everything they experienced today was so sweet, and when she recalled those moments, all of them were raising her expectations infinitely.After all, Ruoruo and Hongxue had done such intimate things with Mingyuan.But, she still needed to secretly create an accident to make Mingyuan have close contact with her twice.And in order to make the process of falling in love with Mingyuan seem reasonable, in order to finally have a reason to kiss him.She had prepared so much and paved the way for so long before finally waiting for such an excellent opportunity.It would be an excellent romantic situation, and it was more likely to be the only chance she had in her life to enter Mingyuan’s heart and the most important opportunity.But it was because of the appearance of Liu Mengning, a bad woman, that she had to hand over this opportunity.The foreshadowing she worked so hard to make, the secret efforts, and even the restraint she imposed on herself time and time again. The infinite hopes and expectations that had accumulated due to this, all fell heavily from the sky and broke in front of her eyes.Although it was a choice she made voluntarily, why did she have a fragile crack in her heart?But, beyond her expectations, and to her great surprise, Mingyuan actually chose to keep her at this moment.He abandoned that bad woman Liu Mengning and chose me!All the hard work and foreshadowing I have done before have not been in vain!If it wasn’t because he liked me, how could Mingyuan be willing to do such a thing for me?The surging emotions in her heart almost turned into tears, but Xia Xueqi held it back, and tried her best to pretend to be disgusted and patted his hand and said, “Su Mingyuan! Anyway, I didn’t want to date you for a long time. And at the right time, your goddess Liu Mengning appeared, let go and find her!”Even at this moment, she was still acting stubbornly.Yes! Su Mingyuan’s statement was enough for her.I already know your intentions, so Mingyuan, why don’t you continue to follow your character and act in front of Liu Mengning.Even if you choose to let go again at this moment, my heart will not be the least bit sad anymore.But… Will it really not?Then why am I struggling so weakly, and what I say is so disgusting. Why are my eyes flushed, and shrouded in mist, with lingering affection?Of course, Su Mingyuan couldn’t make a stupid choice like letting go at this moment.Since you want to act, then I will act with you, but letting you go…Impossible!“What nonsense! This is an important date under the watchful eyes of the two families, how can you leave?” He firmly and domineeringly grabbed her hand, and forcibly pulled her to the brightly lit paradise.“Xueqi, before the date is over, you must hold my hand and stay with me today. You are not allowed to go anywhere!”At that moment, Su Mingyuan’s overbearing declaration made Xia Xueqi’s heart tremble, and she was filled with infinite emotion and joy.She suddenly felt that even if Liu Mengning continued to disrupt the situation later, it wouldn’t matter if the romantic surprise at the amusement park tonight was completely destroyed by her.What she wanted was never a surprise romance, or rather, Su Mingyuan’s domineering and gentle behaviour at the moment was a real romantic surprise for her.As long as she was sure that he was in love with her, everything else was not important.Because, she had really walked ahead of everyone.Using her own strategy, she truly entered Mingyuan’s heart.She believed that if those women were facing the same situation and showing the same fragile expression as her, Mingyuan might be tangled and embarrassed, but he would never make the same choice, and he would never hold back.Because, they were only seducing Mingyuan with their bodies, although this would arouse his temptation for a while, it was just a false feeling aroused by the instincts and desires of the body, and could not be true in the face of cruel tests.And only she, only she who truly entered Mingyuan’s heart in this royal way, would make him feel distressed enough to give up his gains and losses, and hold her hand.When Su Mingyuan led Xia Xueqi back to the gate of the amusement park and walked in front of Liu Mengning, Xia Xueqi had already adjusted her mood and looked at her calmly.Mengning, my good sister, didn’t you think you are awesome?Your scheming to force the situation has made my relationship with Mingyuan go a step further!“Liu Mengning, I’m sorry, no matter how deeply I was obsessed with you before, no matter how scumbag you think my behaviour is now. But, let me tell you, today I am dating Xia Xueqi. We will just keep going, no matter what you say or do next, you can’t stop this from happening!”Su Mingyuan held Xia Xueqi’s hand and made a solemn declaration in front of Liu Mengning.Fuck the plot collapse, anyway, I have to fix it every time after that, so whether the degree of collapse is bigger or smaller, does it make any difference to me?I won Xueqi completely here, isn’t it really saving the plot collapse that may occur in the future?Maybe it was because he thought through it, or maybe it was because he chose to look at the problem from another angle. In short, when Su Mingyuan faced Liu Mengning now, he was extremely firm and full of confidence.Your nature is sloppy and unrestrained, so what if you are a chaotic variable?I was able to handle you last week, so can’t I do the same this week?Facing the calm gazes of the two of them, Liu Mengning looked at Xia Xueqi, then at Su Mingyuan, and finally her eyes fell on the interlocked hands.After being silent for a while, she raised her head and said a classic speech comparable to a defeated dog.#pleaseredthischapteratWONDERNOVELS.COM“Your date with Xuexue, no matter what I say or do, I can’t stop it, and it will continue.”“Then… What about mine?”***
