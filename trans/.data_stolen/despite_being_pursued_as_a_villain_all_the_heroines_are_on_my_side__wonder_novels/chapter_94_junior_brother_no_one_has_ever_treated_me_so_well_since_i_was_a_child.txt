Xiao Ran had just concluded a very important interview.And Murong Hongxue’s.He suffered so much humiliation yesterday, and lost a large number of his brothers. Only Viper escaped and remained alive but injured.There should always be something to gain.And what he got was that the Su Xia family had let him go, and that his security company could finally start business with Murong Hongxue’s nod.Although……He would have to split 60% of the profits.But he was not short of money, what he lacked was contacts, and the network of forces that were inseparably linked.He and Murong Hongxue met just now to discuss this matter.Murong Hongxue said that since she took 60% of the profits, whether it was for supervision or to make the gains bigger and better to share more profits, it was reasonable there should be her people in this company.This reason was very legitimate, so Xiao Ran did not refuse.Not only did he not refuse, but he couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.Since Murong Hongxue has sent someone to join my company, then this company is not only mine, but also hers. Isn’t this just like I hooked up with her thigh, this huge network?When the business develops more smoothly in the future and the profits become more and more abundant, Murong Hongxue will undoubtedly become more closely tied to me, which is equivalent to getting on my chariot.At that time, as my partner, not only will she have an inseparable relationship with me, due to this profit and mutual influence penetration, I can also use her network and influence to attract more people and build a bigger power network.A bright future is just around the corner!I endured humiliation last night to take this most important first step now.Just to spread out my network of influence!Even……After more and more contact with Murong Hongxue in the future, she will become more and more inseparable from my business profits. Will I also have the opportunity to have a kiss with her…Thinking of Murong Hongxue’s identity as the underground queen, and her charming and seductive figure, Xiao Ran unconsciously had such a fantasy in his heart.When the relationship with Murong Hongxue changed from hostility to partnership, when she no longer had to look at her with hostile eyes.As the male lead, he was naturally attracted to Murong Hongxue as the female lead.Of course, this was also inseparable from his lustful nature.If the male protagonist of Urban Xiaobaiwen was not lustful, how could he make a big harem?Even if he behaved very seriously and never teased girls, if he was not lustful in his heart, why would he immediately stand up to help a hero to save the beauty when he sees a beauty in distress?He still had a dream about Xia Xueqi in his heart, but this does not prevent him from having a manly fantasy about Murong Hongxue, a peerless beauty.After the two sides ended the meeting relatively happily, Xiao Ran ushered in another good news.“Boss, the mysterious man in the white trench coat came to you again last time!”“Junior brother came to see me?”Xiao Ranteng jumped up from his seat excitedly, and immediately went downstairs to look for Su Mingyuan outside the company building.It was a pity that Murong Hongxue had already ended the meeting and left, otherwise she would have just happened to meet Su Mingyuan, the white knight who came to look for Xiao Ran.Of course, if Su Mingyuan hadn’t been able to look for Ruoruo’s help after watching the surveillance camera, he would definitely have arrived earlier, just when Xiao Ran and Murong Hongxue were meeting.The two missed it perfectly again, but unfortunately neither of them knew about it.Outside the building, Xiao Ran finally saw this mysterious junior brother for the first time.He was wearing a wide white trench coat with a pure white mask on his face, revealing his eyes, nose and mouth.When the two met, a gust of wind happened to blow, raising the hem of the windbreaker,making Su Mingyuan look extremely handsome and mysterious.“You…” Xiao Ran stepped forward excitedly, but didn’t know what to call him for a while.Su Mingyuan smiled slightly. “Senior Brother Xiao Ran, I have no name or surname, but I was enlightened by Immortal Master Li Wuya who taught me the magic power of my dream. You can just call me Junior Brother.”“Senior brother!”Xiao Ran’s shout was very sincere. He never thought that his ridiculous guesses and thoughts were actually true!That fairy-like old Taoist priest had really turned into a fairy! In the dream, he taught his disciples and younger brothers the magical powers, and enlightened him!He excitedly stepped forward to hold Su Mingyuan’s hands, and a trace of Mingyu’s true energy quietly penetrated along the contact surface of the two palms.Another strand of True Qi protruded from Su Mingyuan’s palm, and just at this moment, it collided with the strand he was testing. Su Mingyuan smiled slightly and said, “Senior brother, I’m also learning the divine art of creating a heaven and clear jade from my master, so you shouldn’t doubt my identity now, right?”Xiao Ran finally felt relieved, believed the identity of the white knight in front of him, and smiled awkwardly at the same time. “Junior Brother, that… I’m sorry, mainly…”“Senior brother, needless to say, I understand you. After all, after you met the Immortal Master, he had already emerged, so how could it be possible to teach a disciple?”“So, Master, is he really…really…immortal?”  Xiao Ran asked in disbelief.Su Mingyuan smiled mysteriously and didn’t answer, as if the secret could not be revealed.The more you say, the more flaws would eruptAnd he didn’t know how to continue, so it would be better to let Xiao Ran figure it out by himself.After all, what he made up in his own mind was the information that made him the most convinced.“In short, senior brother, although my magical power was taught by the master in a dream, after all, the original version of it was obtained by you. Therefore, having learned this magical power, I naturally have to accept your information and answer this kindness.“And I’m your junior brother, so I should try my best to help you. But…”Su Mingyuan started to make things up again. “Senior brother, in addition to divine arts, I also happened to be taught some heavenly mysteries by the immortal master, and now I’m already half a member of the mysterious sect. I must always pay attention to avoiding heavenly secrets and reduce the entanglement of cause and effect.”“So, although I will try my best to help you, complete your revenge plan, I can’t do it all, and sometimes I will be unable to help you because of my lack of skills. I hope you can understand a thing or two at that time.”Su Mingyuan wqs patching himself, and he didn’t want to really worry about this stupid son all the time. He just needed to help occasionally, but Xiao Ran had to let his old father do everything for him?Then what do you want to do?When Xiao Ran heard these words, he was naturally moved. He made up his mind that in order to help him, his younger brother was disturbed by heaven’s secrets and was entangled in karma, and he quickly said, “Understandable, understandable, I thank Junior Brother, how can I blame you?”‘Oh, you still have some conscience.’Su Mingyuan smiled slightly and took out a piece of jade from his arms.“By the way, Senior Brother, I know that you need spiritual jade to cultivate Mingyu Magic, and you have been wronged by Su Mingyuan, so I sneaked into his villa last night to help you steal this jade. Ha, you I don’t know how angry he would be when he found out that Spiritual jade was missing this morning.”Seeing this familiar piece of spiritual jade in Su Mingyuan’s hand, this piece of treasure that was lost and found, Xiao Ran felt extremely guilty and moved.The younger brother said it was an understatement, but the security and defence around Su Mingyuan’s villa, how could ordinary people easily sneak in?“Junior Brother…!”His eyes were a little red, and he held Su Mingyuan’s hands again excitedly, looking at him very moved.Apart from his parents and Ruoruo, who would help him get revenge after he was wronged for so many years since he was a child, and treat him so unconditionally?#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAs a big man, Xiao Ran, who believed that a man should bleed but not shed tears, was moved to cry at this moment.‘Woohoo, Junior Brother, you really…’
