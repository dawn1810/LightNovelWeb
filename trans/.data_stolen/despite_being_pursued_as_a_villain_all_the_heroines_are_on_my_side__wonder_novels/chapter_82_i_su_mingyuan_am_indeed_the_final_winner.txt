When he saw Xia Xueqi’s stunned face, two beautiful red clouds quickly climbed up her face, incurring a blush out of her fair cheeks.Su Mingyuan was so happy that he wanted to laugh.Hahahaha!What was this? What was this?This is a good Samaritans’ reward!I didn’t blame the waiter just now, so the water he spilled on the ground helped me and assisted in the unexpected coincidence.On the contrary, this bad woman, Xia Xueqi, always wanted to control me and hold me down. She liked to act cold and arrogant.And she was so evil that she wanted to use my leverage to threaten me and force me to submit?Hehe, now that you’re such a bad woman, you’re going to get what you deserve, right?This time, not only your mouth, but also your chest landed on the palm of my hand!Seeing that I wasn’t in a “passive” position, I was forced to bully you and avenge you for bullying me!It was really soft, and it was big and elastic. It felt like he would never get tired of playing for the rest of his life…Those lips were also so sweet and delicious, and there was a hint of coldness around it, instantly refreshing him.It was awesome!This was especially true, combined with Xia Xueqi’s delicate and alluring face, her eyes that were gradually getting blurred, and the occasional soft voice that came from her lips.The immense sense of accomplishment and conquest made Su Ming fly into the air. He couldn’t help but feel even more unrestrained.The movements on his hands increased, and the attacks on her mouth became even more ferocious.He looked at Xia Xueqi’s helplessness and felt her completely soft body in his embrace.Su Mingyuan could say it proudly.He was truly holding Xia Xueqi in his hands now!Under the willows by the lake, there was a person who was so angry that he gritted his teeth and trembled all over.In the unoccupied corner of the restaurant, Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi felt the joy and enjoyment of bliss at the same time.It seemed that because her top and bottom were attacked at the same time, Xia Xueqi’s will to resist was further disintegrated compared to last time.This time, Su Mingyuan broke through the line of defence.He successfully had a negative distance contact with her and he took advantage of her.This date, this war, it seemed that Xia Xueqi had always firmly grasped the rhythm and suppressed his aura.However, his final suppression was just an illusion that he deliberately performed. He deliberately pretended to be a prey, but in fact he was a clever hunter.More importantly, he also survived another accident with the help of God, attacked Xia Xueqi and seized the upper hand, making her become defenseless.After her first kiss was taken away by him last time, Xia Xueqi was stunned by his tactic of putting the blame off himself.He was the ultimate victor!In the hidden part of the restaurant, a waitress was holding a camera and secretly taking photos. These photos would be taken back and stored by Mr. Xia later.And after Su Mingyuan enjoyed it for a full ten minutes, under the constant warning of the last trace of clarity and reason.He was about to slip away.If he didn’t stop, this bull was about to explode.If he didn’t stop, he was about to lose his mind in this extreme comfort, and what would happen then…He was a good man with a good nature!So now that he had taken advantage and had tasted her enough, why would he wait?Could it be that when Xia Xueqi recovered her strength, she shouted indecent assault in front of the whole restaurant, and let him die by a group of people watching the club?At that time, it would be too late to sneak away!Su Mingyuan finally greedily enjoyed it again, then took a big step, left his seat in an instant, and ran away.“Xia Xueqi, I have something come up, I’ll go first, we’ll have a chance next time to kiss and touch.”Su Mingyuan disappeared at the door of the restaurant in a flash, rushed into the car, and ordered the driver to drive home quickly.It was so exciting, so cool.It wasn’t until he got into the car that he had time to close his eyes and reminisce about the beauty just now.Oh, yes, and after going back.I wouldn’t forget to give this restaurant a five-star review, two accidents, two enjoyments, and two victories, all of which happened here hahahaha!After a while after Su Mingyuan left, the blush on Xia Xueqi’s face slowly subsided.#pleasereadthischapterat wondernovels.com“It’s a pity, I didn’t expect Mingyuan to be so timid and run away like this…”The ordered dishes had not been served, the lunch had not been eaten, and there was still more free time for appointments in the afternoon.But he just ran away!Obviously she also made some preparations, whether he wanted to take her to the cinema, the aquarium, or the Ferris wheel after the meal…Unfortunately, these might only be used next time.However, her purpose was achieved on this date.The good feelings she got here from Mingyuan would be real, and they would steadily improve step by step. They would not be as abrupt as other women who appeared to be so abrupt when they were written. They were just an existence that could easily collapse like a castle in the air.It was because she finally got closer to Ming Yuan, and this time, even more deeply, he almost lost himself in her beauty.In this way, even if she had not shown her love and deep love for Mingyuan according to the progress of the strategy, but was in a state of admiration, she could naturally make some intimate actions towards Mingyuan without appearing abrupt and strange.After all… more intimate things had been done.She gave two bank cards as rewards to the two waiters. Xia Xueqi put away the SD card and prepared to enjoy these photos when she went back.When the truth would be revealed in the future, when she unfurled these photos in front of Mingyuan’s eyes, he might look shy.#pleasereadthischapterat wondernovels.comIt was not until these follow-up treatments were arranged that she was free again, and could sit quietly in her seat and reminisce about the beauty and enjoyment just now.Fingers slipped unconsciously over her wet and glossy lips and the plump and seductive towering breast. Then, Xia Xueqi put her legs together, and a blush gradually appeared on her face.“Xueqi, my good sister, you really surprised me!”A cold greeting woke her up, she turned her head, and met Su Xuelan’s cold and angry face.***
