She didn’t think Mingyuan would just hide in the small room to calm down by himself while her older sister Xueqi followed his trail and went after him right away.She also thought about whether she should accept it if Mingyuan took advantage of her since no one was here, and she was dragged into the room by him.But the scene she wanted to see didn’t happen because Xia Xueqi rushed in for no reason, destroying her fantasy.And before she went in, she patted her on the shoulder and asked her to watch at the door!It should be my brother Mingyuan and I in the small room!As a result, now, the poor Ruoruo could do nothing but stand at the door and listen to the noise.Not only that, but she also had to pay attention to what was going on around her at all times. She couldn’t let anyone find out the adultery of the two in the room. Ruoruo felt so uncomfortable that she wanted to cry.In the room, Su Mingyuan, who had just sat down, thought that Ruoruo came in, but when he looked up and saw the person coming, he suddenly showed a surprised expression.“Xueqi, why are you here?”“Shouldn’t you be at the banquet?”“There are some hypocrites at the banquet. Talking to them will make me sick, so I might as well come to you.” Xia Xueqi smiled and walked straight towards him.As she approached step by step, the cold and arrogant expression gradually melted. Her eyes became warm and loving, and a faint blush appeared on her cheeks, adding a touch of beauty to her alreadyalready mesmerising beauty.“Mingyuan, I’m sorry I was busy last time, so I could only refuse your invitation.”Xia Xueqi sat on his legs, gave him a hug, and pressed her soft, round body against his chest.“But now, at least for now, we can meet briefly, and I can compensate for the second refusal.”Her figure was already sexy and hot, but she had always suppressed everyone with her iceberg-like aura.But now, she seemed soft. She felt like she was melting when she looked into Su Mingyuan’s fiery eyes. The charm of a peerless beauty was fully exuded, evoking Su Mingyuan’s physiological reaction, and a violent stream of desire arose in his heart.Xia Xueqi licked her lips seductively, put her arms around his neck, and was about to kiss him.But……This cannot continue on!Now was the performance time and the plot point. She was Xiao Ran’s helper, not to be Su Mingyuan’s lover.How could she leave Xiao Ran behind and meet up with me privately during this performance?She should have been with Xiao Ran, who insulted me, yet she did such an intimate thing with me behind his back.In case this is included in the system’s evaluation and assessment…This is not insulting me, this is clearly humiliating Xiao Ran and greatly reducing my final evaluation!Su Mingyuan’s heart was hot, and his desires were out of control, but at that moment, he was able to use his head. When he saw how excited Xia Xueqi was, his body wanted to, but his mind told him not to.If it was outside the usual time for performances, of course he was eager to do such pleasant things with Xia Xueqi, especially secretly behind Xiao Ran’s back… This would only make him more excited.But, in this crucial performance, something like this suddenly happened…Su Mingyuan immediately reached out and pressed Xia Xueqi’s shoulder, preventing her from approaching.“Xueqi, don’t forget our purpose today, if you are seen like this by Xiao Ran…”“Don’t worry, Mingyuan, Xiao Ran doesn’t know that I’m here to find you.” Xia Xueqi put the strand of hair behind her ears and smiled charmingly. “And even if he knew, Ruoruo, who is at the door, would help us perfunctory him.”With that, she leaned down and tried to continue kissing him.How could Su Mingyuan let her succeed?Although it was indeed very exciting, he felt a wave of panic and fear when he thought of the consequences of this action.If he did something sexual with Xueqi here, the system would definitely reduce the score significantly, right?The perfect evaluation would become dream because of this?Su Mingyuan didn’t want this to happen. He never got a perfect one during the second week. He wanted to achieve it and prove himself.But, Xia Xueqi was ignorant of everything. She only knew that she could only think about Mingyuan these past days. According to the original plan, after the night of the Ferris wheel, she should have had more appointments with Mingyuan, step by step. Quickly growing the seed of love that she planted, and let him fall in love with her.But, because of Murong Hongxue, she could only imagine those sweet scenes over and over again in her heart. She could only turn on her phone at night and look at their intimate photos to quench her thirst. She really felt intolerable…How could she give up the chance to be close to Mingyuan now that she had it?Anyway, now is not the plot time, it will not affect Mingyuan…
