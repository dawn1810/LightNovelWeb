Only if Su Mingyuan confronted Xiao Ran as the villain in accordance with the novel’s original plot would she refrain from interfering in order for the story development to remain the same.As for other times, especially in this kind of private space, of course, she could do whatever she wanted with Mingyuan, and the plot of the novel didn’t describe the action of Mingyuan at that time, right?So, she couldn’t help missing him and met Su Mingyuan to quench her thirst.However, Su Mingyuan’s entire performance began the moment he walked through the hotel door!Even if there was a 1 in 10,000 chance, he would never humiliate Xiao Ran with Xia Xueqi in this place!The protagonist was Xiao Ran! It was not him, Su Mingyuan!Facing Xia Xueqi’s approach again, Su Mingyuan gently pushed her away again.“Xueqi, don’t do this.”“???”If the first rejection was justifiable, then this second time, Xia Xueqi was really annoyed.Suddenly, she sat upright on top of him, and the blush on her cheeks and the tenderness in her eyes vanished instantly.Her eyes turned exceptionally cold.If she was a volcano that erupted with enthusiasm just now, then now, she was a polar iceberg that was freezing to the bone.She was obviously seated on Su Mingyuan’s thigh, with her thighs pressing against his, but he did not feel any attraction; rather, his heart jumped and grew cold as she stared at her menacingly.Damn, this really pissed Xueqi off!Yes, except when Xia Xueqi was moved by his grand and romantic surprise last time on the Ferris wheel and kissed him for the first time.This was the second time she had taken the initiative, with tenderness, joy, and enthusiasm after not seeing him for so many days.However, she was rejected.“Su Mingyuan, do you believe that I, Xia Xueqi, am frivolous and lowly, that I was moved by a fireworks display the last time we met, and that you made me fall in love with you? Then you can suppress me at your discretion, or even consider that I am no longer worthy of you. Is that it?”Seeing Xia Xueqi squinting slightly, her eyes revealing a trace of killing intent, Su Mingyuan felt slightly uneasy.Under her imposing power, he suddenly figured out one thing.Why did he pursue Xia Xueqi?It was so that she could obey his own arrangements obediently in the future, and cooperate with him to complete the next performances in order to get high evaluations. In short, gain a lot of Villain Points and Reinforcement PointsIf he did intimate things with her here, there was a possibility that the perfect evaluation of this performance would end up being downgraded to excellent.But if he completely shunned Xueqi in this situation, her favorability would plummet. She would be dismayed and repulsed by him…After that, as long as there were drama performances with her appearance, there would be a great possibility of a complete failure.A small defeat or a terrible result of a big defeat after…Su Mingyuan shivered suddenly in his heart, and while feeling scared for a while, he slapped himself inwardly.What stupid thing did I just do?!From the perspective of long-term vision and interests, I should not have behaved so foolishly just now. When Xueqi kisses him, I should cater to her, envelop her in my arms, and respond with a more fiery assault.He quickly grabbed Xia Xueqi’s hand, looked at her affectionately, and wanted to make up for it quickly. “Xueqi, you think too much, how could I have such despicable thoughts about you. We are allies and we are engaged. Husband and wife, we are the couple who made vows on the top of the Ferris wheel.”“Since you’re willing to initiate a hug and kiss, I feel joy, sweetness, and happiness; how could I possibly wish to reject you?”Seeing Xia Xueqi’s gradually softening expression, he quickly blushed and pretended to be a little embarrassed, and said in a small voice, “You.. just sitting on my body so condescendingly, being kissed by you from top to bottom, I feel a little… a little embarrassed. I… I want to be on top…”“You want to be on?”Xia Xueqi’s expression completely softened. Nevertheless, the pair of eyes gradually glowed with a fiery desire. There was also a hint of a queen-like dominating aura.“That’s probably impossible, Mingyuan.”Her index finger hooked Su Mingyuan’s chin, her thumb rubbed his reddish cheeks, and she stared at the man she was pressing down, her delicate red lips slightly evoking a charming smile.“Because from now on, you can only be under me!”After speaking, the domineering queen launched an assault, bowed her head, and subdued the man beneath her with a deep, hot kiss.Su Mingyuan didn’t dare to refuse this time.Rather, since it was already this way, why not choose to enjoy it?He put his arms around Xia Xueqi’s plump and charming body, and responded with a more enthusiastic attack.As he previously stated, he should now wrap his arms around her, hold her tightly, and when she kisses, unleash a more ferocious assault and subdue her!‘On the first floor of the hotel just now, it was you, Xia Xueqi, who sneered at me.’‘Look at me now if I don’t teach you a good lesson with this eloquent little mouth, I won’t be able to utter a single word!’At the door, Ruoruo bit her lips aggrieved, and wandered around the door unconsciously. She sadly thought in her heart: What the hell are sister Xueqi and brother Mingyuan doing in the room?‘Perhaps, perhaps they simply conversed and did nothing excessive…’Banquet hall.Xiao Ran, who had just finished talking, stood up and subconsciously searched for Xia Xueqi’s figure.Looking around, he didn’t see where Xia Xueqi was. Instead, he saw Ruoruo, who was wandering around the door of a room in the side hall.Then, he suddenly recalled that he had not seen Ruoruo in a very long time.Su Mingyuan was far away from him, and now might be a good opportunity to talk to her.Considering this, Xiao Ran took a large step forward and walked towards Ruoruo.
