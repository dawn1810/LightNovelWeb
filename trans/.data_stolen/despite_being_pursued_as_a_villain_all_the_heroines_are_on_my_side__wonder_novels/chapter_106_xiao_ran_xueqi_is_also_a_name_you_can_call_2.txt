These were all things he secretly called Ruoruo, and learned from Ruoruo. Fortunately, Ruoruo was not implicated by Su Mingyuan at that time, and she was not used to vent his anger.Then, naturally, the cooperation conversation with Murong Hongxue and Xueqi went very smoothly.The security company’s business could finally start, and the newly established film and television company would also have Xueqi to help. She also said that she would take him to Liu Mengning’s film investment meeting in a few days.If he could win this investment opportunity, it would just give him a name for this newly established film and television company.Not only that, but after being reminded by his younger brother, he realised that the two old men who played chess with him in the park these days really had a lot of background. They were actually the old masters of the Liu Ye family!He felt that he was already familiar with these two old men. If the two old men were willing to come forward and say a word, the bad reputation he had been smeared in the Blue Rose Bar might be eliminated.After all, the old lady of the Liu Ye family said that Xiao Ran was a good boy and a good guy.Could he really be a bad guy?Everything before that was just that he was young and frivolous, and he didn’t know what to say.In fact, his nature was not bad, and he knew his mistake and apologised sincerely to Su Mingyuan. He was still a good person in essence!As soon as he said such words, wouldn’t his reputation be saved?In just one day, Xiao Ran had encountered so many good things.So Xiao Ran was naturally refreshed and happy today.It just so happened that he had not returned to China for many years. Although a new film and television company had been established, he did not know what the tastes of domestic audiences were now.So he decided to come to the cinema in his spare time to watch the most popular domestic films during this time, and to feel the preferences of domestic audiences.As a result, he just came to the ticket hall, and he was a little surprised that there was no one in this movie theatre except the staff. When he was about to buy tickets, he heard a clear high heel behind him, and when he turned his head, he saw walking hand in hand, Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi together.His face suddenly turned dark.He actually met Xueqi and Su Mingyuan who were dating again, again, and they held hands again!And Xueqi was dressed so beautifully!Xue Qi had never been so well dressed in front of him, and she had never even let him hold her hand once!But now, but now…!If it wasn’t for seeing the disgust on Xia Xueqi’s face, if it wasn’t for knowing that she was actually acting, and under the pressure of the Xia family, she had to endure disgust and discomfort and pretend to date Su Mingyuan, if he didn’t know that Su Mingyuan was impotent.At this moment, Xiao Ran would really be furious, angry, and beat Su Mingyuan into meat sauce with an irrational punch!This was the woman he liked, the goddess that even he thought about day and night and couldn’t even hold her hand!But she was held by Su Mingyuan, a trashy bastard, and showed a mocking smile at himself!And.When he tried to hold Xueqi’s hand yesterday, Xueqi developed a sense of fear and disgust because of the last time she held hands with Su Mingyuan.Now she was acting with Su Mingyuan holding hands with Su Mingyuan under extreme nausea and discomfort, so this was not aggravating her symptoms and making it more difficult for her to let go of this knot.It also made it more difficult for him to hold her hand after Xiao Ran!And if one cAn’t even reach the step of holding hands, then hugs, kisses, etc., will be far away.And all of this was because of the hateful Xia family’s oppression, because of this shameless Su straw bag!“Yo, Xiao Ran, why don’t you come to the movies too?”Su Mingyuan took Xia Xueqi’s hand and walked towards him. His expression did not appear so arrogant and domineering, and his tone was relatively flat, but it made Xiao Ran feel a sense of extreme contempt and ridicule.This piece of shit… how dare he look down on me like this!Xiao Ran clenched his fists immediately.At this moment, he really wanted to ridicule Su Mingyuan with the matter of losing the jade to get back some ground.But when he thought that this was not just exposing his own shortcomings, and possibly exposing his junior brother, he could only hold back abruptly, not bothering to look at the ugly and arrogant face of the other party, but turned his head to look at Xia Xueqi.“Xueqi, are you… okay?”He only felt extremely aggrieved in his heart, if his previous behaviour was slightly restrained, if his power was so strong that the Xia family was afraid, if…But there was no if, and there was no if in this world.Now he couldn’t do anything other than endure this grievance and pain, and care about Xueqi!This made him feel more ashamed and uncomfortable.On the night of Hongyun Building, all the brothers who came by plane except the Viper were all wiped out, which gave him a deep understanding of the strength of the Su Xia family for the first time.It also made him understand the truth more profoundly. China was no better than foreign countries. The water here was very deep. Even if it was not as good as the Xiao family, the hidden family, none of the four major families were friendly.So before his power grows, he must endure and live.He was now Qianlong Zaiyuan, and all he needs was development. In ancient times, those who achieved great things were not only talented, but also had the will to persevere.Although he had extraordinary talents now, he must also have perseverance and the will to endure what ordinary people couldn’t bear, in order to achieve great things!Thirty years of Hedong and thirty years of Hexi, his current forbearance was  for better revenge in the future!It was just… he felt bitter for Xueqi.At this moment, his eyes were full of sadness, anger, pain, sadness and other emotions.On his face, expressions of anger, helplessness, melancholy and hatred flashed one by one.Su Mingyuan never thought that someone in this world could show so many emotions and expressions in an instant.Looking at Xiao Ran who wanted to be angry but didn’t dare to be angry, wanted to hate but could only hold it in his heart, and couldn’t do anything other than ask Xueqi a word of concern, he felt in his heart that it  was so refreshing.#PLEASEREADTHISCHAPTERATWONDERNOVELS.COMBut even so, Xia Xueqi didn’t seem to want to let him go, she would draw a line with Xiao Ran in front of Su Mingyuan today!“Xueqi? Xiao Ran, you are my partner. You can call me Xia Xueqi, or you can call me President Xia. But Xueqi is such an intimate name, can you also call me that?”Xia Xueqi looked at him with a frosty face, her eyes full of disgust. “Especially when you call me that in front of my fiancé, what vicious thoughts do you have in your heart!”
