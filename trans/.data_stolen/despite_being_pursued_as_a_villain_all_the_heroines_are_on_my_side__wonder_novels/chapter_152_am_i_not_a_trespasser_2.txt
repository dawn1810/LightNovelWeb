Umm, hold on a moment! If I place Ruo and Mengning together, will he be able to counter the Asura field if something goes horribly wrong?If the continuous, uncontrollable plot collapses due to the Shura Hall,Seeing that Liu Mengning had begun to pinch Ruoruo’s watery cheeks, it was as if she had become very familiar with Ruoruo in a short time. For some reason, Su Mingyuan suddenly felt that there was no need to worry at all.Ruoro always reassured him.And Mengning…Even though she was always so unpredictable, he felt like he could trust her.Watching her giggling and teasing Ruoro, Su Mingyuan suddenly looked forward to the coming crew’s trip.He always felt that he would have a good time with her and Ruoro there.Su Mingyuan left at ease.Let’s just chill out during these few days at home.The following plot performance was another one-man show between him and Xiao Ran. The general content was that he, the villain, had gone through a series of pretenses and get slapped in the face by Xiao Ran. Especially when he faced Xiao Ran’s super high strength and had to put his bodyguards around him every time, he decided that he needed to find a better bodyguard.Therefore, he went to the famous underground black boxing arena in Ming City, planning to choose a ruthless character as his new bodyguard and become a hyena that could bite people under him, and then that bodyguard naturally collided with Xiao Ran again.As a result, the ruthless character he fancied was not only not conquered by his money offensive, but was convinced by Xiao Ran’s heroism and willingly followed him, thus creating a wave of righteous and heroic images of the protagonist.The above plot was very simple, and it was just him and Xiao Ran. He likely didn’t have much to worry about. He only needed to say hello to the several female protagonists in advance and let them not come forward to interfere.At this point, the strategy’s benefits could be seen.Although it was a bit hard in the early stages, once the relationship progressed to a certain level, he didn’t need to work hard secretly; just a phone call could eliminate their interference and variables.If I still try hard to stick to the original plot and make them like Xiao Ran, like I did last week, can I make it that easy for them to do what I want?Not to mention that they may be able to unlock more CG and benefits in the future, hehehe…Su Mingyuan was extremely sure that he was on the right path to clearing the level!And after this plot was over,  it would be his turn to play the next performance, which would be a one-man show between him and Ruoruo.If this cute baby cooperated, it would be another easy performance.So he was only sad for a moment about last night’s loss, and soon his heart flew to the next two performances.No matter how unsatisfied Xiao Ran was, when it was his turn to play a one-man show and show his heroism, he could undoubtedly look forward to and believe it.Although this son often did things that went against his wishes, there was still nothing to worry about.Obviously, Ruoruo was a good one!Not considering these two scenes, a perfect evaluation would definitely win.And after these two performances were over, it was almost time to go filming with Mengning.Well, think of it this way: the series of things that happened next week were all good things!When he came home, Su Mingyuan’s face was full of happy smiles.“Mom, it’s been a while!”He gave Su Mu a big hug.As soon as she let go of her embrace, Su Xuelan walked up with a smile.“What about me, Mingyuan? Won’t you hug your big sister?”Su Mingyuan’s movements only froze for a moment.Then he opened his arms again and hugged his “nominal sister.”“Sister, long time no see!”At the moment when he held Su Xuelan, Su Mingyuan’s heart suddenly jumped, realizing that he was actively hugging the heroine.Should this be…He had no deep feelings about Su Xuelan’s. This was just a normal hug between brother and sister, which was not an act of aggression against the female lead. The system does not deduct his villain points.He secretly breathed a sigh of relief.I was careless.After kissing Mengning last night, the boundaries in his heart quietly became much more blurred. The tension in his mind was not as obvious as usual, so he didn’t realize how risky he was at first.Speaking of it, he made up his mind for the first time last night. He would rather be deducted a villain point than kiss Mengning’s lips, but he didn’t expect that she would take the initiative to come forward. The villain points were not deducted.After that, it was no longer clear whether Liu Mengning was taking the initiative or was passive, and it was impossible to tell whether those actions counted as violating the heroine.Anyway, the system didn’t deduct it.And the hug with my sister just now was not deducted.Of course, it was a bit unreasonable to deduct everything like this. After all, Su Xuelan, as the heroine, neither resisted nor struggled. He didn’t have impure thoughts about her, let alone make any moves. It was just a pure embrace between sisters and brothers, so it doesn’t need to be deducted?Then, in case the rescue of people was urgent and he escaped from the fire with the other party in his arms, would that also count as violating the heroine?Su Mingyuan felt as if he had vaguely grasped the bottom line of the system’s definition of violating a heroine. Either the other party took the initiative, or he didn’t have that kind of dirty thought in his heart when he was having intimacy with the other party?But these women were all top beauties. He and she had no control over how intimate they would get.No way! He was an open and upright man; how could he not have the slightest idea when he was intimate with the other party?After careful consideration, it seemed that only when facing her sister, Su Xuelan, could he barely do this.Well, I can try it on my sister these days.In this way, maybe he could take the initiative to embrace Mengning, Ruoro, Xueqi, and Hongxue without worrying about the deduction of his villain points.Well, at least if it was just a simple hug, he could guarantee that he wouldn’t have that kind of thought about it.Holding hands, hugging…In this way, he didn’t need to rely on them to take the initiative every time in the future. He could also embrace them in his arms.Su Mingyuan thought about this in his heart, and he didn’t even notice that the smile on his face got brighter.In Su Xuelan’s eyes, Mingyuan was happy and excited to see her and give her a hug.Yes. This time, Mingyuan was asked to go home to live, not only because Mom hadn’t seen him for a long time but also because she missed him.The most important thing was to prove in front of my mother that Mingyuan didn’t mind being close to me even though they weren’t related. This way, her mother could be sure that she would support her and Mingyuan being together, and then she could help her convince her dad…Didn’t you see that Mingyuan was already so happy just hugging her?Hmph, you finally realized that your sister is a good person, didn’t you? You believed I had wronged you outside and were upset with me.Su Xuelan led Su’s mother with one hand and Su Mingyuan’s arm with the other and walked into the house. The family looked very warm.This time, Mingyuan will live at home for a few days, and I can finally get close to him and enjoy this good time that belongs only to me and him.Ah, I can’t help but want to have a relationship with him as soon as possible, and then I can…However, the three had just sat down, and the fantasy in Su Xuelan’s mind had just begun.Just then, there was a ding-dong, the doorbell rang, and someone came to visit.Xia Xueqi arrived unexpectedly.
