The old man of the Ye family was slick, thinking that Xiao Ran could continue to play chess with him in the future, but he didn’t want to pay any emotional cost.“I think by the nature of this guy, he will always come to us everywhere to ask for help.”The old man of the Liu family felt a little sullen in his heart.“Then looking at his junior brother, we can help him once or twice at most. After that, no matter how much he begged us, unless his younger brother came forward to plead, we would just ignore him anyway. Do you think this is reasonable, oldman Liu?”The old man of the Ye family said something, so he was able to appease the old friend.Looking at Su Mingyuan, who was chatting quietly with Liu Mengning, he slightly revealed a little hint of pride in his heart.What if you are truly uninterested in fame and fortune, proud and arrogant, and your chess skills are far superior to this old man?As long as that stinky boy Xiao Ran begs me, then you, as his junior brother, have to come forward to plead for him.At that time, I will wave my hand and swing the chessboard. You must lose to me on the chessboard in exchange for an agreement that I will support your senior brother.Humph!Last time, in order to attack my mentality, you first showed weakness, and then attacked me with a thunderbolt, which was bound to break my defenses.Next, I’d like to see if you dare to be crazy in front of this oldman for the sake of your brother.And the other side.“I can call you whatever you want?”Liu Mengning looked at Su Mingyuan’s white costume, then suddenly blinked at him and asked, “Can I call you My Big Hero?”Without waiting for Su Mingyuan to answer, she grinned with a bright and beautiful smile on her face.“Hello, My Big Hero, my name is Liu Mengning, and I am glad to meet you.”She took the initiative to shake Su Mingyuan’s hand. Compared with her attitude towards Xiao Ran, it was simply different.My Big Hero?I’m not a pet…But, Su Mingyuan didn’t correct it either, and Liu Mengning liked it.With the personality of this bad woman, even if he corrects her, she will probably continue to shout with a cheerful face, right?“By the way,My Big Hero, I’m curious, why are you wearing a mask? Don’t you want me to see your handsome face? Well, can you show it to me secretly? I promise I will be a good boy who keeps my mouth shut and will never say it!”Liu Mengning leaned up affectionately, held out her finger and made a secret gesture around her mouth. Her eyes blinked and twinkled, making Su Mingyuan’s heart palpitat.She always knew people who had a good feeling for her like this, and she got close quickly.“Liu Mengning, I am equally curious about what a big star like you is doing when you sneak here without a bodyguard,” Su Mingyuan immediately changed the subject and said.After spending so many times with Liu Mengning last week, he already knew that if he didn’t want her to know something, he must not follow her topic and be brought into the rhythm by her.As soon as the topic changed, Liu Mengning did not continue to entangle this issue, but she pulled the corner of his clothes and gently dragged him to the lake.“Why am I here?”“Because I suddenly wanted to draw a landscape painting, I came here to sketch.”“By the way, My Big Hero, do you want to take a look at my painting?”Although the two did not hold hands, unconsciously, the atmosphere was already very harmonious, and their relationship seemed to have been brought very close.Xiao Ran only recovered from Liu Mengning’s smile, and saw her take the initiative to hold Su Mingyuan’s clothes and let him admire her landscape paintings.They appeared talented and lovely, made for one other as they stood by the lake with their shoulders almost touching. There was a breeze and weeping willows in the background.And Xiao Ran, what about him?He stood alone like a fool, accompanied by the grass under his feet and a few green leaves spinning in the wind.He wanted to move forward and participate, but after only a few steps, he stopped when he heard two people discussing painting techniques, colour schemes, and style.……He halted abruptly, for the first time feeling frustrated with his little understanding.At that moment, the old man of the Ye family appeared in front of him, patted his shoulder, and said impatiently,“Xiao Ran, did you come here today to play chess with this oldman, or to see your junior brother fall in love?”“Others are talented and beautiful, naturally they are a natural couple.”“You stinky brat! Come play chess with this old man and don’t be a third wheel!”Oldman Ye really couldn’t watch any more, so he came out of the woods and drove Xiao Ran away.Others are chatting with each other, looking at the landscape. You are standing here. What’s the matter with you?Only then did Xiao Ran remember why he had come here today. When he realised who the old man in front of him was, he didn’t dare ignore him, so he had to go with him.It was just that even if he left, he walked very slowly and reluctantly.Looking back at the picture of Su Mingyuan and Liu Mengning leaning together, he always felt as if he had lost a piece in his heart.He always had the feeling that as soon as he left in this way, something important and valuable would be gone from his life forever.So, he turned his head and walked slowly.He couldn’t help but take a look.Another look.Take another look.Old Man Ye became impatient. “It’s not refreshing to dawdle. What do you mean, you son of a bitch, are you still thinking about robbing your junior brother’s wife?”Oldman Ye, what are you talking about!?How did she become my junior brother’s wife?Junior brother just happened to help her out of the siege. Her present attitude of closeness is just gratitude to her benefactor. How can there be any kind of love, how can they be a natural pair?#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe real world isn’t feel-good online novels, where does this kind of love at first sight come from?Who could rob my wife…Liu Mengning is not my junior brother’s wife. She is simply thanking him now. It is impossible for her to fall in love with him at first sight.It’s not that I don’t have a chance. How can you judge so arbitrarily?It was just that as soon as he saw the frown and expression of Old man Ye, Xiao Ran immediately dared not say a word.He could only whisper so in his heart.—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
