Su Xuelan was extremely confident at the moment, and she was also very excited.Especially when she learned from Li Cheng that Mingyuan didn’t go out to mess with flowers in the past two or three days, and stayed in the villa obediently. None of those bad women who coveted Mingyuan had succeeded, and her mood was even better, and she felt very happy.Wait, when I break this relationship, and with the support and help of my parents, do you still want to take Mingyuan away from me?At that time, I will only leave a small position for Ruoruo, and she will have to listen to me obediently.As for the rest of the people…hmph, don’t even think about it!At the same time, Xiao Ran was also very proud in the past two days.After playing chess with Oldman Ye and Olman Liu in the park that day, he hesitantly asked the two elders for help. Unexpectedly, the two elders did not refuse.“In return for your love for playing chess with us for so many days, we will certainly help you this time.”Really?As long as the security company opened, isn’t that the difference between zero times and countless times?These two old people are really cute. If you help, they will help, and they deliberately say something with a cold face. What word is used to describe this appearance is very accurate, arrogant? Yes, that’s the word!With the words of these two old men, his reputation suddenly improved again. He finally recovered his lost momentum, and regained the confidence to raise his head in front of everyone.He had become a good young man who was young and frivolous, but he can bend and stretch when he knows his mistakes. Moreover, thanks to the names of these two old men, the business of his security company had been successfully expanded all at once.In the past two days, he made a lot of contacts, and there were some instances when he pretended to be slapped in the face. He also met Ye Chen’s brother, Ye Tian, ​​one of the last four gangsters in Ming City.But, that was just what he was called before. Since the Ye family handed over more family affairs to Ye Tian and began to exercise his abilities.This dandy who used to like to collect antiques completely lost his former halo of evil youth, and began to emerge gradually.Ye Tian was currently mainly engaged in the Ye family’s foreign trade industry, and although Xiao Ran was understaffed in China and had no power, he had many industries and friends abroad.In addition, Xiao Ran’s third group of men were already on their way to China from abroad. By then, his security company would not only be able to expand further, but would also be able to allocate a large number of people to help Xueqi control the Xia family.He felt as if everything was going perfectly, and his former luck was returning back to him.What surprised him even more was that the bodyguard named Li Cheng beside Su Mingyuan was really persuaded by him and was willing to be his undercover!Although after getting acquainted with Oldman Ye, Oldman Liu and Ye Tian, ​​Xiao Ran felt that Su Mingyuan was no longer a scumbag, and there was no need to look down on him. After all, he was the eldest son of the Su family, and he had his most desired spiritual jade.In the future, it might be a very important thing to overthrow the Su family or subdue the Su family. Besides, if he was still with him, Li Cheng could also take care of him if something happened.Should I call Ruoruo back on my side?When this thought popped into his mind, he asked Li Cheng, the closest and most trusted bodyguard to Su Mingyuan: how Ruoruo was doing with Su Mingyuan.“Miss Ruoruo has not been tainted by Su Mingyuan in any way, and it seems that because of that agreement, she is now quite trusted by Su Mingyuan. Brother Xiao, don’t worry, I’ll be watching from time to time!”He got such a reply from Li Cheng, and once again affirmed from him the fact that Su Mingyuan couldn’t play with women because of his impotence, and he was relieved immediately.Yes, I provoked Su Mingyuan like that last time.After he went back, he just punished Ruoruo for not being allowed to eat and clean up. I don’t have to worry about him doing anything to Ruoruo!In that case, let Ruoruo stay with him.In fact, Li Cheng was making up the story from his heart. Although he vaguely felt that the relationship between the young master and Miss Ruoruo seemed to be somewhat ambiguous, even as the bodyguard closest to the young master, he could not see him and Miss Ruoruo making out at all.Because as soon as he returned to the villa, he could only guard at the entrance of the villa and around, and he had no idea what happened in the villa. Everything inside was strictly guarded even from the closest guard like him.He looked at it all the time, he never saw anything from the beginning to the end, and said this just to reassure Xiao Ran!Xiao Ran was really relieved, because whether it was Ruoruo or Li Cheng, the news from them convinced him of Su Mingyuan’s true situation.It’s impossible for these two to join forces to deceive me, right?What a joke, how is this possible!Heh, Su Mingyuan, I’m afraid you can’t think of it, now you are surrounded by my people. I will see what you will do with me in the future!When Xiao Ran was lost in his imagination happily, he didn’t know it.Su Mingyuan, who he was extremely relieved about, was kissing his sister Ruoruo’s soft and delicious lips in his villa, while enjoying the service from her fragrant and soft little hands.So, the time came to the day when Liu Mengning and Xiao Ran had an unexpected encounter.Su Mingyuan didn’t forget to give Ruoruo a sweet parting kiss when he left this time.After hugging and kissing her enough, he secretly changed into a white knight suit in an unoccupied corner and set off.This time, he was going to rescue Liu Mengning before Xiao Ran, completely gaining her favour!Son, it’s not father who insists on intercepting your good thing, but I know that even if I give you the opportunity, it’s useless, and you still have to rely on your father to make up for the plot later.In this case, Dad, I will simply be a good person to the end, and help you do all the things that save the beauty of the hero. I will perfectly control and arrange all the performances in the future. At that time, you only need to play in your true colours, and you don’t have to worry about anything at all.Like this, you can comfortably walk to the peak of life.This well-intentions, son, you should be able to understand, right?Well, don’t be too moved, this is what I should do as a father!Su Mingyuan felt that he was really selfless and great. Last week, he didn’t dislike Xiao Ran, and he did his best to help him.In this week’s episode, he was still able to disregard his previous grudges and spared no effort to make more preparations and efforts behind the scenes for him.Do you know that a father’s love is like a mountain?I just hope that in every performance in the future, my stupid son can be stronger, show his rebelliousness, show his aura of the protagonist, and don’t give in to the villain last time and beg for mercy again.While sighing, he rushed on the road.Soon, Su Mingyuan appeared at the place where the two were about to meet.At that time, the plot had not yet started. He hid behind an ornamental tree, waiting for Liu Mengning to appear.—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
