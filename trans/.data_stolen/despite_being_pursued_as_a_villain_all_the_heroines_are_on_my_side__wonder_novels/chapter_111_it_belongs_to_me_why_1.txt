Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi had their dinner and came hand in hand to the amusement park that he had already chartered in advance.It was already night, and darkness loomed around the entire vicinity.“Mingyuan?” Xia Xueqi looked at him with some confusion.Su Mingyuan smiled faintly at her, took outhis cell phone and sent a message.At once, the lights of all the facilities were turned on at this moment under his command, and the seven-colored brilliant light bloomed like a colourful and fantastic flower, illuminating the whole dark world.The doors hung with colored spheres of lights, and the rides and stages were decorated by various colours of light.The mischievous lights intertwined with the cheerful and melodious music.The dark silence in the shadows of this huge building looked scary previously, but, at this moment, it instantly turned into a fantastic castle.No woman could not be moved by such a romantic moment.Xia Xueqi was blushing at that moment, staying on the edge of drunken intoxication and the illumination of the light looked incomparably bright.“Mingyuan ……”Xia Xueqi opened her eyes wide, and the pair of ice-cold beautiful eyes shone with hearts.The romantic surprise Su Mingyuan prepared for her really made her feel very romantic and surprised.Su Mingyuan faintly turned his face sideways to look at her expression, and was also very satisfied with her reaction.This dreamy castle would be open only for the two of them tonight, and just this scene now had already made Xia Xueqi’s heart beat fast.If they waited until the grand fireworks afterwards, what kind of expression would appear on her face?What kind of feelings will she have for him?However, at this time, just when Xia Xueqi and Su Mingyuan were both looking forward to the date tonight in the castle.An unexpected guest appeared on the scene.“When I just went to ask the staff, I was wondering who had chartered such a large amusement, but I didn’t expect it to be you, the young master of the Su family.”Liu Mengning appeared in front of the two with an elegant and unobtrusive pace.“I didn’t expect that I just wanted to experience the feeling of riding a roller coaster on a whim, but it turned out to be a coincidence that I met you guys here.”She took off her sunglasses, revealing a stunningly beautiful face that could captivate any man, and smiled faintly at the two of them.“It’s been a long time, President Xia. And my suitor, the young master of the Su family, Su Mingyuan.”Looking at the two people’s somewhat intimate appearance, her gaze shifted down slightly and fell on the interwined hands of the two people, and the smile at the corner of her mouth became somewhat playful.“Seeing you guys like this, I’m a little curious.”“Since you, Su Mingyuan, were pursuing me with such ardent deadly madness, why are you now dating another woman instead, and holding hands with her?”At this moment, Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi’s mood was really like a roller coaster ride. When they reached the peak, someone instantly knocked them down to the bottom by words alone.Xia Xueqi really did not expect that at this most romantic and critical moment, Liu Mengning would appear here to spoil her game!When she and Mingyuan went out for the first time, Liu Mengning didn’t show up.When she and Mingyuan went out for the second time, Liu Mengning did not show up either.However, just when she thought that this time Liu Mengning would still not show up, she came!Some people, when you do not want them to appear, would knock your door.This was a big fucking surprise! A shock!Su Mingyuan was even panicking at this moment.One should know that the next drama was Liu Mengning’s home turf.He also thought to find time to pretend to be a white knight to chat with her, to ensure the smooth progress of the plot, and the normal performance.The result was that he, as Liu Mengning’s suitor, was caught in flagrante delicto here, caught on the spot dating Xia Xueqi?Especially since Xia Xueqi herself had a cooperative relationship with her. She was the spokesperson of Xia Xueqi’s XuanmeiCompany, and the two of them had a good relationship in private.After all, one of them was Su Mingyuan’s fiancée, one of them was being pursued by him, and both of them hated him before. Su Mingyuan, and inexplicably had an emotional connection with the same enemy.Now, Xia Xueqi betrayed the sisterhood and spat about Su Mingyuan with me, but secretly dated him behind my back?What do you mean? Betray me?Liu Mengning was so angry that she even shouted out “President Xia”, knowing that she used to address Xia Xueqi as “Xuexue” in private!Of course, she actually didn’t care about the relationship between these two people..But after that movie investment plot, Xiao Ran was able to take the investment quota, it was relying on Xia Xueqi’s strong recommendation, and in the days before the investment meeting began, he met with Liu Mengning in advance because of some small coincidence, these combined factors, so that he finally stood out.But what if Liu Mengning felt that Xia Xueqi had betrayed her, and also hated Xiao Ran, who was Xia Xueqi’s partner. What if, due to that, she did not choose Xiao Ran.Then how could he, Su Mingyuan, complete the performance of being hit in the face by Xiao Ran!How would he get a high evaluation, get a lot of Villain Points?This time, it was no longer the silly son Xiao Ran that pitted him, but he himself pitted his son first!At this moment, Liu Mengning’s sudden appearance completely caught Su Mingyuan off guard.His brain was spinning madly, racking his brains to think of a remedy.In fact, there was only one way that was not an option.That was to explain to her that this date between himself and Xia Xueqi was only due to the authorization of the elders of the two Su Xia families. What Su Mingyuan really liked and pursued was Liu Mengning.At that moment, he could only shake off Xia Xueqi’s hand without hesitation and walk towards her firmly and obsessively, telling her of his love.This barely explained the reason for their date, which was in line with his infatuation with Liu Mengning to the point of almost licking the dog’s persona!The most important thing was that many of the subsequent episodes were due to his crazy pursuit of infatuation with Liu Mengning. So, he clashed with Xiao Ran, who was also pursuing Liu Mengning, and then was tragically hit in the face, and could only resentfully and desperately watch the other side step by step conquering his goddess’s heart, secretly vowing to retaliate back, and then more conflicts unfolded.So this persona he had in front of Liu Mengning, at least at this point, must not be broken.Especially now that he hadn’t figured out how to fix Liu Mengning.Otherwise, all the actions he showed in accordance with the plot later were pale and feeble false performances in front of Liu Mengning, and she would see past it in a second.With her chaotic carefree character, when she was to make a bigger plot collapse, Su Mingyuan would not be surprised!She was such a person, last week’s show left a deep experience to Su Mingyuan.Under fire, he rushed to save her as a knight in white. Everyone panicked, screaming and shouting, but she stood at the centre of the flames accompanied by a shallow smile, and said to him, “Knight, if I were to dance here with flames as a stage, do you think it would look good?”She was tied to a rope, and was almost about to fall. Countless people were anxious for her below the stage, ready to launch rescue measures, but she looked like she didn’t care, and stood there with shocking calmness. There was no panic in her eyes.Eventually the rope broke, even if the air cushion was prepared, everyone could not help but suck in a breath of cold air at this point. They were nervous to the extreme, but she opened her arms, with a smile on her face, clothes and ribbons fluttered behind in the air. She looked like a fairy who fell into the mortal world, and was caught by the hastily arrived Su Mingyuan.That scene was beautiful. She leaned in Su Mingyuan’s arms, smiling and asked the director whether he had just filmed that beautiful scene, as if she did not care whether she would fall and even die.Su Mingyuan chided her with fear and asked if she was really not afraid of death, but she smiled and stroked his cheek, gazing into his eyes and said, “I’m not afraid, because I know you’ll come to save me.”Liu Mengning was like this, she would sneak out in the middle of the night to play in the sand by herself on the beach and pile up a nice castle.And suddenly run to the highest part of the city, light a lantern and watch it float up into the sky.This was really bad, because you do not know what she would suddenly do on a whim, and bring you strange and bizarre consequences.For example, tonight, who would know how she suddenly wanted to experience the feeling of riding a roller coaster, and then so very coincidentally met them by chance.Liu Mengning’s nature was too elusive. Facing such a situation, Su Mingyuan only had one choice.That was to comply with his infatuation with Liu Mengning’s persona, tell her that this date was only forced by the elders of both sides, and then without hesitation, leave Xia Xueqi behind and go to Liu Mengning.In this way, the variables could be minimised so that Liu Mengning did not act as a demon and the plot would not get off track.But would this be a little too …… heartless for Xueqi?
