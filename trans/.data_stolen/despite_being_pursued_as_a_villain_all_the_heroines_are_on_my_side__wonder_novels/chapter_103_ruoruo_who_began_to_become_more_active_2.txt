Xia Xueqi didn’t know yet, because she was stimulated by her date with Su Mingyuan, now Ruoruo was trying to overcome her shyness and became more proactive and bold.She was now sitting in a high-end restaurant, waiting for Su Mingyuan’s arrival.This was Su Mingyuan’s restaurant, but unfortunately it was not the lakeside restaurant where the two dated twice.She deliberately put on makeup today. She didn’t need too much modification on her delicate face, just light makeup.One the upper body, she wore a white lotus leaf collar short-sleeved top, which not only showed her smooth and soft slender arms, but also highlighted her plump and towering advantages.The black skirt was slightly outlined at the slender waist, making one want to measure it with the palm of your hand. Below the skirt were seductive black silk and high heels, and with her own cold and arrogant temperament, she looked  full of incomparably seductive femininity.When a man saw her, he would only have two thoughts in an instant, either he wanted to be trampled under her feet, or he wanted to conquer her under him.When Su Mingyuan arrived at the restaurant and saw her for the first time, he was completely amazed.At this moment, the thought in his mind was that if he could win Xia Xueqi in the future, he must make her change into this outfit, and press her under him and ravage her fiercely.But when he thought of that damn rule, he suddenly realized that the person who was being oppressed at that time was probably himself.Xia Xueqi came here just in time. She never liked to wait for others, nor did she like to let others wait for her.It turned out that Su Mingyuan was actually a few minutes later than her.“Sorry, I’m late, there is some traffic jam on the road.” Su Mingyuan apologized very gentlemanly as soon as he sat down.In fact, the real reason was because when he was leaving, Ruoruo kept him so much that he couldn’t help kissing her for a while longer, otherwise he would have just arrived at the time.Seeing that the two guests had arrived, the waiter came over and poured red wine into the goblets of the two, and then whispered to the back kitchen to prepare the dishes.Of course, Xia Xueqi couldn’t get angry because of this trivial matter.She slightly evoked a faint smile, raised the wine glass and gently shook the red wine inside, looked at him playfully and asked, “Then how are you going to apologize to me, Mingyuan?”“I’ll punish myself with a drink. I wonder if I can win this lady’s forgiveness?”Xia Xueqi raised her finger with a smile. “Three cups.”“Okay, then three cups.” Su Mingyuan did not refuse, and drank three cups.In his itinerary, today’s lunch was not the focus.The first two appointments with Xia Xueqi just ended before they even started, and they didn’t even finish lunch.On this date, he wanted to extend the time as much as possible, to shorten the relationship and distance with her as much as possible, and to continue this date into the evening.So, he couldn’t make a big move as soon as he came up, but prepared to pass this lunch, first pretend to talk to Xia Xueqi about the alliance, get acquainted with each her quickly, trying to make the atmosphere as harmonious as possible, and lay the groundwork for the future date.So this lunch, he did not arrange any special arrangements, except for this bottle of red wine.Of course, he didn’t put any medicine in the wine. This was a famous wine with a very normal price.The only side effect was that he didn’t feel anything when he drank it, but he actually had a lot of concentration power.Su Mingyuan hoped that after this lunch, Xia Xueqi could date him in a less sober and drunken state.In this way, he would have more room for manipulation. Occasionally, when the atmosphere was right, he would do something intimate with her, and she would not refuse.So the task of this meal was to make Xia Xueqi drink as much red wine as possible while maintaining a good and harmonious atmosphere of chatting.As for him punishing himself three times as soon as he came up, would he be drunk?Joke! He had the divine art of creating a clear and bright jade, and a mere amount of red wine couldn’t make him drunk.The atmosphere of dining and chatting was indeed more harmonious and harmonious.While negotiating with Xia Xueqi about forming an alliance, Su Mingyuan took this opportunity to persuade her to drink a lot of red wine unknowingly.He noticed that as time passed, the snow-white and crystal skin on Xia Xueqi’s face had gradually turned a little blush.Her temperament and attitude were not as arrogant and cold as before, and she softened unconsciously, and her eyes were not so cold as they looked at him.Everything was going according to plan!He shook his fist excitedly in his heart.Of course, in the process of persuading her to drink, he was also persuaded by Xia Xueqi to drink a lot of alcohol, much more than Xia Xueqi’s.But I have magic, what am I afraid of?“Sorry, I’ll go to the bathroom first.”In order to stay awake at all times, Su Mingyuan was going to go to the bathroom to get rid of alcohol.And as soon as he left, the blush on Xia Xueqi’s face, the softness in her eyes disappeared, and the aura of the Iceberg queen instantly returned.She wasn’t drunk from start to finish, she just pretended to cooperate with Su Mingyuan.How could she have the guts to get started without giving him a chance?At this moment, Su Mingyuan’s cell phone suddenly vibrated on the table.Xia Xueqi didn’t want to read it, but the message popped up on the screen automatically.She didn’t peep, she just accidentally caught sight of it.But since I’ve got it, let’s take a look.She picked up the phone, clicked on themessage, and found that the message was sent by a strange woman in the mysterious software.She didn’t expect that after so long, such evil software hadn’t been deleted by Mingyuan.She didn’t even expect that when Mingyuan was dating her, there were women who dared to take the initiative to tease Mingyuan and want to hook him away from her.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels .comMoreover, she still clearly remembered the profile picture of this strange woman.It was the woman who was cut off by Su Mingyuan in the lakeside restaurant when she asked Miss Sister for the first time this week.Okay, that’s all I got kicked out last time.This time, you still dare to dig my Xia Xueqi’s corner?Xia Xueqi’s eyes suddenly turned cold.
