He was literally blinded by anger!He was really complacent, and for such a momentary refreshment, he almost ruined the real event!Just because of such a bit of self-esteem that he couldn’t let go of. Because he was mocked by Su Mingyuan with a few words, he forgot that he returned to China this time for revenge, to spread the network of influence and destroy the Xiao family!And now, because of his lack of calm and logic, because of his stupidity, he almost couldn’t even perform the first step!However, it was really difficult for him to bear it any longer!A man’s dignity, a man’s self-esteem, was really not that easy to let go!What Should I do?Do I want to choose to apologise to Su Mingyuan at this time?Just now he scolded Su Mingyuan in high spirits in front of everyone, but now he had to change his attitude and ask for his forgiveness in a low voice?And… in front of Ruoruo, in front of his sister!Besides, I didn’t have time to prepare for this ceremony!Unless……But, but…I first confronted Su Mingyuan and raised the price of this spiritual jade to 50 million. As a result, I bought this spiritual jade with my backhand. How can I give it to Su Mingyuan as an apology to ask for his forgiveness?This…doesn’t it make me look stupid, like a joke?Doesn’t that make me look like a clown at all?Thinking of this, Xiao Ran’s mood suddenly became choppy, unable to calm down.He couldn’t accept such a result, such a shameful result for others to make fun of.“Sir, please mute your phone or turn on aeroplane mode at the auction venue.” At this moment, a waiter came over and reminded him.“Oh, well, I see.”Xiao Ran turned the phone to silent, but still didn’t put it down.He was still waiting, waiting for someone’s news.Now that Murong Hongxue knew the news of his meeting with Su Mingyuan, Xueqi must also know.Well, I’m afraid she’ll be sending me a message soon, too?At this moment, his mood was messy, and he really didn’t know what to do.Therefore, he desperately hoped to see the message of that person.After a while, Xia Xueqi’s message came.[I heard about your meeting with Su Mingyuan. Don’t think too much, and don’t have too much burden. Just do it according to your own heart and thoughts, no matter what choice you make, I will support you.]Woo woo woo…Xueqi, you really…As soon as this piece of information came out, it completely killed Xiao Ran’s last stubborn resistance.In a flash, Xueqi’s last rare touch of tenderness to him on the phone call that day reappeared in her mind: “No matter what choice you make, I won’t blame you.”Then, he recalled that she ran around in the Su and Xia family for him, and suffered all the scorn, ridicule, and grievances.Ah!At this moment, Xiao Ran clenched his fists, gritted his teeth with difficulty, and was about to make a decision.“Heh, Xiao Ran, looking at this picture of you knowing that you’re about to lose, but you can’t help but show your ugliness. Your teeth are so tightly clenched that you can’t help biting people? Heh, a wild dog is a wild dog.”At this moment, Su Mingyuan’s ridicule arrived in time.In fact, the moment he heard Xiao Ran’s cell phone ring suddenly, and the moment he saw Xiao Ran pick up the phone, his face changed instantly. An ominous premonition suddenly came to his mind.At that moment, the self-confidence was blown down by the unknown and dark future.Su Mingyuan watched the subtle changes in every expression on Xiao Ran’s face, and his heart also twitched.No, no, no, no!Everything went so smoothly and the performance was so perfect. Could something go wrong at this last moment?Xiao Ran, Xiao Ran! Son!Son!What are you doing!Impossible!Everyone in this world can change, but the most unlikely person to change is you!I know you so well, so I believe in you, you will definitely not give me a sudden limit reversal when I am at the door, right?Right!Su Mingyuan panicked, and the ominous premonition became clearer and clearer.He clearly knew that with Xiao Ran’s character and personality, it was impossible for him to be soft. But for some reason, such a premonition suddenly appeared in his heart.And I feel that such a hunch will come true in the next moment!Couldn’t Xiao Ran… really plan to make a reversal when I can’t afford it, and let this ancient jade be given to me?Su Mingyuan’s heart was completely chaotic and panicked.So he immediately ridiculed Xiao Ran, he wanted to provoke Xiao Ran’s anger. He must not let this performance be screwed up!By the way, not only that, but also Ruoruo, if it is his sister, how can he not be provoked and endure like a tortoise?After the ridicule, Su Mingyuan immediately leaned on the back chair of the sofa in a lazy and leisurely manner, instructing Ruoruo to pour him a cup of tea, and then said, “Ruoruo come here, give me a massage.”Ruoruo glanced at Xiao Ran timidly, but in the end, under Su Mingyuan’s fierce stare, she had to walk behind him and massage his shoulders and head.Like a poor little girl who was bullied by the evil young master.And with such a level of ridicule, Su Mingyuan didn’t believe that Xiao Ran couldn’t break the pretence, and he didn’t believe that he could endure it!#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comSure enough, seeing Ruoruo under the pressure of Su Mingyuan, forced to pour him tea and massage him, Xiao Ran’s heart was ignited again.Such a massage… Ruoruo hadn’t done it to him yet!But then, in his mind he remembered what Xia Xueqi told him before.Because the last time he humiliated Su Mingyuan’s face, if Ruoruo went back, she was not only punished to stay hungry, but also punished to clean the whole villa by herself…If he couldn’t bear it at this moment, and didn’t choose to apologise, completely breaking his pretence with Su Mingyuan, she would definitely have a harder time!Whether it was for Xueqi or Ruoruo, for the revenge plan, for the business to be able to expand, he would become just a joke today, buying spiritual jade and giving it to Su Mingyuan in exchange for an apology. What else could he do?
