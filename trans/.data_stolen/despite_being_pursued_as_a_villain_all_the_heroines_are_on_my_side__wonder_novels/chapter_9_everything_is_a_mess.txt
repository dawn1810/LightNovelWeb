Soon later, footsteps could be heard outside the door.Su Mingyuan regained his composure as he waited for Xiao Ran and Xiao Ruoruo to enter.Even if I didn’t understand why Xiao Ruoruo suddenly changed her attitude, I was sure that Xiao Ran would not let me down.The first encounter would remain unchanged from the original plot!I believe in Xiao Ran!Soon upon seeing them enter through the door, he put on his arrogant face, lifted his glass to taste the wine gracefully, and gazed at Xiao Ran with scorn.“How are the two of you going? Have you decided?”“Yes,” Xiao Ran replied in a loud voice.Su Mingyuan became more confident upon hearing Xiao Ran’s firm tone.This is what I expected!Besides, how could Xiao Ran agree to let his sister submit to a scumbag?“Then you take the 2.5 million…”Before he could say the word ‘out’, Su Mingyuan heard Xiao Ran say,“Su Mingyuan, Ruoruo will stay at your company and continue to be your intern secretary during the contract period, you will have to follow the previous agreement on compensation since this is a write-off.”What?!What did he say?!Su Mingyuan’s eyes widened as he couldn’t believe what Xiao Ran had said.You, Xiao Ran, the King of Assassins, the male protagonist of a genreless feel-good online novel, actually agreed to put your sister under a scumbag villain like me?Did I hear you right or have you just simply given up?Su Mingyuan had no idea that, following Xiao Ruoruo’s disruptive behavior, Xiao Ran would have problems as well!He’s in a state of panic at the moment.If nothing follows the original plot, how does he expect to play as a villain in every plot and earn the required villain points?This was a world that evolved from a novel. His villain role-playing system, according to the plot of the novel, the role-playing tasks are released and the villain points are rewarded.Therefore, he must follow the plot of the novel and appear every time he should appear and be hit in the face by the protagonist.It’s okay if some minor parts change, but the main plot must stay unchanged no matter what happens.That means everything must be in line with the novel plot.Only in this way can he get the villain points!If the plot changes, the text in which he was supposed to appear will disintegrate, same as the system’s role-playing tasks, and he might no longer have any villain points to earn.Moreover, how the fuck can he save enough points to return home without the villain’s points?Even last week, the plot’s development had a few problems, so he had to correct them personally — but overall, everything was progressing according to the plot. However, it was not like now, the first scene was completely messed up!At this point, Su Mingyuan’s heart was in knots.But in the scene, Xiao Ran was still warning vigorously in a tone full of disgust for Su Mingyuan.“Su Mingyuan, pay attention to what I’m saying! Even though Xiao Ruoruo is your intern secretary, she is not one of those ladies who would be lured by your power and will stand by and let you harass them. She only does the work that a secretary should do, and other than that, don’t even think about it!”“If you bully her, she will use her cellphone to take pictures and gather proof any time. So keep your wishful thinking, it will never come true!”When he finished speaking, he stared at Su Mingyuan’s stunned expression, certain that his threat had been effective.At this time, he was still oblivious that what he had done was a stupid decision.He would probably have noticed something was wrong if he had seen Su Mingyuan and Xiao Ruoruo kissing before breaking into Su Mingyuan’s office at that very moment.However, he didn’t see it.Because the moment Xiao Ruoruo heard the sound of someone knocking on the door, she took the initiative to retreat and distance herself a few meters away from Su Mingyuan.At this point, Xiao Ran was still extremely pleased with himself for thinking carefully.Look at how dumbfounded you are, Su Mingyuan! Did you think that you can bully Ruoruo? In your dreams, of course! But, you didn’t expect your abacus to also fail, did you?And I’m sure you’re aware Ruoruo can also act as my spy and inform me at any time.At the end of her internship period, Ruoruo will steal your jade pendant so that I can improve my Pure Jade Divine skill…A sneer appeared on Xiao Ran’s lips.Hehe, Su Mingyuan, you tried to steal a chicken only to end up losing the rice you used to lure it? You definitely didn’t expect such a result, did you?Looking at Su Mingyuan’s still somewhat sluggish appearance, he turned and left against the light, leaving Su Mingyuan with a silent and handsome back.Bang!Only then did Su Mingyuan come back to his senses and put the raised glass down on the table.At the same time, an unpleasant sound from the system came to my ears.[Ding! At the end of the performance, a comprehensive evaluation of the host, results are being made…][Your evaluation for this performance is: Pass.][Based on the passing evaluation, you finally get two hundred reinforcement points that are equal to the villain points.]Passing evaluation! Two hundred villain points!Before the performance, Su Mingyuan vowed not to get a perfect evaluation to get one thousand villain points, and with his invincible acting skills, he would definitely be able to get at least nine hundred points.Unexpectedly…He felt that he performed very well, even extraordinary, but Xiao Ruoruo and Xiao Ran—They didn’t follow the script!The plot was messed up, it was supposed to be a perfect wave to attract the huge hatred of both the brother and the sister — but now it seemed like it only attracted the hatred of Xiao Ran alone.He looked at Xiao Ruoruo, who was left behind, and sighed. He waved his hand and commanded her,“Go to Su Mei and ask her to find someone to change the door. Also, send those two useless garbage to the hospital.”Xiao Ruoruo raised her head and looked at him with a tired expression, something faintly flashing in her eyes.But she didn’t say anything in the end and just responded with a smile.“Yes, President Su.”After Xiao Ruoruo left, Su Mingyuan immediately questioned the system in his heart,“Gou system, come out and explain! Why did Xiao Ruoruo and Xiao Ran become like this?!Especially Xiao Ruoruo, is this really her personality?! Is this how she should behave? You have to give me an explanation!”[Host, perhaps because of the reversal of time, the origin of the world and the overlord have been affected again, resulting in a deviation in the established fate, so Xiao Ruoruo’s character design varies from the original novel setting.][Just like the host you transmigrated into this world last week, it also damages the overlord. In addition to the plot of the novel, there are also some changes outside, which also need to be fixed by the host.][Last week, you delivered the villain role while completing the plot, didn’t you also save enough for a hundred thousand villain points? I’m sure you can do it this time.]Last week, because of the butterfly effect caused by his time travel, Su Mingyuan not only had to play the villain, but also had to deal with some unexpected changes outside the plot.For example, the other villains who were going to target Xiao Ran suddenly got a headache and went to kidnap his woman.Another example, when Xiao Ran was supposed to play a key role to save the heroine and win her heart, Xiao Ran was busy with other things and didn’t go to rescue her at all, etc…Of course, these things have nothing to do with the villain Su Mingyuan, and should not be his responsibility.But if the plot gets messed up, the development of the world would change, and the plot that he should play as a villain would also be gone because of the plot chaos. Then, he can no longer continue to get villain points!So when these similar accidents happened, he had no choice but to pretend to be Xiao Ran’s subordinate and rescued this female protagonist who was in danger because of him, just to let the plot continue in the original trajectory.This time, what fuck went wrong?!In order for the plot to continue according to the original trajectory, the most important thing was to make the plot that he appeared in continue to appear according to the script. He didn’t know how much effort he would have to do to make it up!And the house leak happened to rain overnight, the result of his first performance was actually only a passing evaluation, a mere two hundred villain points…He looked at the sky outside the window, letting out a long sigh, and then asked,“System, didn’t I act well enough today?”[It was perfect. Host, your performance today completely grasped the essence of the villain, that arrogant, domineering, and disgusting villain looks — even I can’t find a trace of mistake.]“Then why the fuck do I only have a passing evaluation?!”[Host, that… I can’t be blamed for that.]
