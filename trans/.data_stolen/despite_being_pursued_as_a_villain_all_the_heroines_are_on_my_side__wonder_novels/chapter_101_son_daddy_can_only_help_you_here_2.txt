Because at this time, he did not invite any masters at all, but opened the chess APP in his mobile phone and chose the advanced man-machine battle.He had experienced the power of the advanced computer man-machine here, and every time he got up, he was killed without leaving a piece of armour, without the slightest resistance.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comHe didn’t believe that this stinky boy could win in front of advanced computer man-machines!Snort!Let you not talk about chess morals and bully me, the old man. Today, the old man will let you know what it means to be someone who is outside the person, and there is a heaven outside the sky!Fifteen minutes later.Old man Ye was completely stunned when he saw the collapsed chess game in front of him.“Why…why…” he couldn’t help muttering.Why is the advanced computer man-machine so vulnerable, not the opponent of this kid…At this moment, his confidence was completely destroyed.At this moment, Su Mingyuan raised his head, wiped the sweat that did not exist on his forehead, and said to him with a look that saw through everything, “Old man, your computer man-machine level is quite strong. It took me so long to take it down.”As soon as these words came out, Old Man Ye was shocked.“You…you actually saw through my means long ago!”In the face of the shock of the other party, Su Mingyuan just smiled slightly, without saying a word.To be honest, fortunately, the only person playing chess with him was a computer man-machine in a mobile APP. If it came from an Alpha Dog.Even if he had master-level chess skills, that was not enough.And looking at the other party’s calm and pretending appearance, thinking of his pretentious appearance just now inviting a master to be seen by the other party who had already seen everything, it was like watching a joke.Old man Ye’s mentality completely collapsed at this moment.Seeing this scene, the smile on the corner of Su Mingyuan’s mouth rose sharply.And the old man of the Liu family, who watched the whole process, saw his old friend’s shrivelled appearance, and he was already smiling from ear to ear.Su Mingyuan achieved his goal, saw the sad expression on the old Ye family’s face, and was about to leave.“Wait, boy, what’s your name?”Seeing that Su Mingyuan was about to leave, the old man of the Ye family hurriedly stopped him.He didn’t think about getting revenge after knowing the other party’s name, his mind was not so narrow, he was just curious.“Old man, the rivers and lakes are so big that we will meet again by chance. What does knowing the name mean to you and me?”Su Mingyuan was about to turn around and leave in a dashing manner.At this time.“Huh? Junior Brother?”Xiao Ran appeared.He looked at Su Mingyuan in surprise and excitement, but he didn’t expect to encounter him here by chance.Hearing Xiao Ran’s call, Su Mingyuan stopped.He didn’t expect to meet him here either.However, since the current situation of this stupid son was not very good compared to the time point of the original plot, then he could just help him and let him seize this opportunity.So he turned to him and said, “Senior brother, I remember that your chess skills have always been good. I just happened to meet these two old people who like to play chess here. You might as well have a game with them. I think it will be a wonderful thing.”After finishing speaking, regardless of Oldman Ye’s retention, he left with a big laugh, and when passing by Xiao Ran, he secretly transmitted a voice to him and said, “Senior brother, these two old men are the elders of the Liu and Ye families of the four major families. If you can become chess friends with them, I think it will be helpful to your big plan.”Son, as your father, I can only help you till here.I have given such obvious hints, you should know how to do it, right?Su Mingyuan said in his heart.When Xiao Ran heard this, he was instantly refreshed and watched Su Mingyuan leave gratefully.He had a hunch before that it would be a good thing to play chess with these two old men.Now, after being reminded by his younger brother, he realised that this was not just a good thing.This was simply that great luck had fallen to his head!He walked over and said to the old man Ye with a smile, “Oldman Ye, the weather is good today, it’s a good time to play chess.”At this time, he didn’t notice that his tone was more humble than usual.Oldman Ye frowned and snorted coldly. He didn’t answer his invitation, and instead said, “Xiao Xiao, can you tell me about your junior brother?”“What?”Isn’t it chess? Why did Oldman Ye suddenly care about his junior brother’s affairs?Xiao Ran was a little confused.***
