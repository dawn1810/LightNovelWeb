It is my turn to performIt was as if no matter how bright the light was, it could not dispel all the darkness.No matter how good the security in Mingjing was, there were still grey areas and underground industries. After all, this was a novel world.Bar, casino, KTV, nightclub, underground arena…At night, it was always easy to hide in the darkness and breed evil.Murong Hongxue was the Queen of the darkness who stood out from the darkness and evil and ruled the entire underground world.Blue Rose Wine Bar.Under the management of Murong Hongxue’s staff, this high-end bar was no longer limited to the functions of the bar.Although its first floor was still a bar, its second floor had already been transformed into a fun club for the children of wealthy families.There was a banquet for the audience, and there were many beautiful waitresses coming and going. They had outstanding figures and beautiful looks, waiting for every gentleman’s polite invitation.Next to the hall were many luxurious private rooms with excellent sound insulation. When a gentleman and a lady looked at each other, they were the love nest of their temporary singing.On the first floor of Blue Rose, it was a bar that was noisy, indulgent, and filled with hormones.The second floor was a place where noble families, wealthy officials, and other gentlemen, wearing refined masks, had friendly and in-depth conversations with beautiful ladies.They looked like they were separated by two worlds, but in fact, they were essentially the same.Following the arrival of the lantern, Xiao Ran brought his good friends from abroad to Blue Rose Wine Bar.Just getting started here would cost everyone 10,000 yuan.He didn’t need to pay the entrance fee if he wanted to go up to the second floor, because the qualification to enter the second floor didn’t depend on how much money he paid.It was an invisible threshold.In the noisy bar on the first floor, Xiao Ran arranged his foreign brothers and called the waiters and waitresses to serve them. Then, he prepared to go to the wine hall on the second floor alone.His brothers were one of the best mens, the elite mercenaries who had experienced the baptism of the battlefield. Most importantly, they were simple-minded and loyal to him.“The boss is treating us tonight. Everyone drink freely, don’t save the boss money. He doesn’t lack a small tip!”“Hahaha, the girls from China are strong, but this wine isn’t strong enough. Hey, bring over the best wine you have here!”“Speaking of the energetic girl, I suggest you try it with a woman from Korea. Tsk tsk ……”Xiao Ran was already used to the dirty words of these mercenaries. In the past, they had done business with their heads hanging on their waists. Their mental pressure was extremely great and they liked to use tobacco and women to vent. Therefore, there was almost no one who did not abuse people in this profession.As long as they were loyal to him and knew how to follow the rules.Xiao Ran left them on the first floor and walked alone towards the stairs on the second floor.He felt that with his previous experience of being brought by Xia Xueqi to a high-class dinner party, it should be no problem for him to enter the second floor of the Blue Rose Bar.His main purpose in coming here tonight was to find a way to get to know Murong Hongxue and prepare for the security company he was going to set up.After all, if it involved security, they would have to deal with the underground world.Moreover, although China’s aristocratic families that held great power liked internal strife, when foreign powers wanted to step into this land, they would often tacitly change their target and choose to go out together.He didn’t lack money or people.However, his money and people came from overseas.If he could build a good relationship with Murong Hongxue, and make use of Xia Xueqi’s connections to make friends with these rich and powerful families, and use security service to deepen his relationship with them, he could slowly develop his power in China.Everyone with money and power cared about their own safety.And he believed that no one in China could compare to his foreign brothers as bodyguards.However, if they were to convince them to use foreigners as bodyguards, these rich, high-ranking, and aristocratic children would probably feel repelled in the first place.Due to that reason, he wanted to visit Murong Hongxue and get to know her. If he could get the authentication of her, his security business would be able to open a gap between these rich people and develop rapidly.Tonight was very important to him.When he was abroad, he had faced such important occasions countless times.At that time, it was as if he had received the blessing of the goddess of fate. There might be some twists and turns in the course of things, but the final results were always good and successful for him.Tonight would undoubtedly be the same.He believed that he would not fail.After leaving the swaying dance floor, the ear-splitting music and the screams of the men and women suddenly became much smaller, as if they were gradually disappearing into the horizon.He took a deep breath and stepped onto the first step towards the second floor, as if he had taken the first small step towards success.At the same time, a domineering Rolls Royce that was unique in the whole world stopped at the entrance of the bar with the roaring sound of engines.Under the protection of the two bodyguards, Su Mingyuan leisurely stepped into the bar.Beep! Trigger the plot and ask the host to follow the plot of the original novel and complete the performance.]#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAt the end of the performance, you will receive 200-2,500 villains points and the same number of enhancement points based on your evaluation.][Host, good luck!]Su Mingyuan walked into the bar with a cold smile on his face , and made his way towards the second floor.‘System, there’s no need for you to cheer for me this time. It’s because tonight, I, Su Mingyuan, will be the villain!’‘I want to show you how I manage to make the scene of an arrogant and despicable villain being beaten to the point where he left in a panic in front of the main character. It will be flawless and lifelike!’‘Ha, all the risk variables have been eliminated by me. If I, Su Mingyuan, get another failing evaluation today, I will eat all the tables in this bar on the spot!’Su Mingyuan put down his words and led the bodyguards behind him to the end of the stairs on the second floor.There, Xiao Ran was standing at the door awkwardly.He thought that he would not be stopped by his experience of attending a high-end dinner party, but from the results, he overestimated himself.Now he didn’t have a big reputation in the upper circles of China, and the last dinner he attended with Xia Xueqi’s partner was not held here.The waiter at the door checked and found that he had indeed attended a dinner party the other day, but he didn’t know whether to let him in or not. He was asking the manager above for instructions, asking him to wait beside him.So there was this scene.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAt this time, Su Mingyuan saw Xiao Ran wandering at the door, and his eyes suddenly lit up.‘Ha, it’s my turn to perform!’He instantly changed his expression, the corners of his mouth rose, his eyes were filled with extreme contempt, and he swaggered towards Xiao Ran with an arrogant gesture of disrespecting his six relatives.“Isn’t this a bereaved dog fired by my fiancée? Why, just you, a stray dog ​​without an owner, who wants to eat swans and wants to go to a party where only the upper class can attend?”As soon as Su Mingyuan opened his mouth, he was extremely mocking, appearing too villainous.***
