As soon as these words came out, Xiao Ran suddenly felt as if he had been granted amnesty, and quickly left the scene without turning his head.This time of torment was finally over.At the same time, Su Mingyuan also let out a long sigh in his heart.Alas, the show is finally over. I hope Ruoruo can bring me good luck.In my last performance, although I still stepped on Xiao Ran’s face to pretend to be imposing, this villain’s arrogant appearance should be able to reduce a lot of that effect, right?Coupled with Ruoruo’s assists…Maybe, maybe I can really expect to pass?The flag set before the performance can never really be hit, right?I missed the table last time, maybe this time…After the performance, Su Mingyuan obviously lost interest in staying at the auction site. After taking spiritual jade from the auction staff, he took Ruoruo out of Hongyun Building.As soon as he walked out of the door of Hongyun Building, the system prompt sounded in his ears.[Beep! The performance is over, and various factors are being considered to settle the results of the host’s performance.][In settlement..]System, I beg you, I really don’t believe in metaphysics, flags or something, it’s impossible to be hit by such a coincidence, right?I have Ruoruo, if you can give me extra points, please do your best, give me an evaluation, and pass it!Just pass!However, the settlement of the system was extremely fast this time, and before Su Mingyuan finished praying in his heart, the final result came out.[Your final evaluation for this performance is: Failed.][You have obtained 200 villain points and the same enhancement points.]No!Su Mingyuan roared in his heart.Although he knew it was just an extravagant hope, he knew that Ruoruo’s assist might be just a small thing, after all, his performance this time was even more outrageous than the previous three times. He actually stepped on the protagonist’s face himself.But at the moment when his hope was dashed, he still felt an unspeakable loss and depression.[Host, don’t be discouraged! One failure is nothing, we still have many opportunities to perform! And you can go home as long as you get an average of 300 villains per show, so don’t be discouraged here!][Cheer up, I believe that you will be able to succeed, host!]“System, whenever this happens, you come out to cheer me. Besides, can you do some practical work!” Su Mingyuan complained in his heart.[But… I am just a system controlled by a program, and all my actions are set under the constraints of instructions and rules.]#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com[In addition to encouraging you, I can’t do anything at all…]“It’s alright, alright. The failure of the performance is because Xiao Ran, the villain, has a problem. I don’t blame you.”Su Mingyuan was just a little sad for a while, just like the system said, as long as the average villain value obtained in each performance was around 300 points, he could go home.He had scored 200, 200, 400, and 200 points in the four performances, which was actually not much worse. As long as any subsequent performance was good or excellent, he would make up for it.How could he have been sad all the time?But at this moment, the phone rang. It was Su Mei, the general manager of the film and television company.She brought bad news.They had followed Su Mingyuan’s orders to contact Liu Mengning before, and their plan to invest in her latest film failed.Liu Mengning refused his private capital injection, and just replied that she would hold a small film investment meeting in Mingjing in five days to raise film funds publicly. If Su Mingyuan really wanted to invest in her film, then he could go to the investment meeting to compete fairly.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comWhat bad news!No, for Su Mingyuan, this was not bad news at all!Because Liu Mengning’s behaviour was exactly the same as what was described in the novel’s plot.Liu Mengning refused his private capital injection, and chose to raise funds publicly. In order to pursue her, he had to go to the investment meeting five days later, and then met Xiao Ran who was brought in by Xia Xueqi.This was the plot of the next show!In this way, Liu Mengning’s character design had not collapsed too seriously, and she had not changed?No, he couldn’t think that way.After so much experience, Su Mingyuan was no longer afraid to guess the occurrence of anything with the worst result.Before the plot began, he must find a way to find an opportunity to test Liu Mengning.But before that, there was one more important question.Xiao Ran.This good son who had always been highly trusted by him. Who had always been optimistic, and would never let him down.In the end, what made him become such a weak, incompetent, and unsatisfactory waste!If he continued to wilt like this in the future, and he chose to endure, how would he play the villain?It seemed that it was time to pretend to be a white knight, as Junior Brother Xiao Ran, and ask him personally.Su Mingyuan weighed the spiritual jade in his hand and thought silently in his heart.Perhaps, I have to encourage him, so that this unsatisfactory rebel can stand up.Alas, this father is really worried about him.and also……Su Mingyuan looked at Ruoruo beside him.Fortunately, I didn’t rant about eating the table or something this time.Spanking Ruoruo’s butt, thinking about it carefully, doesn’t seem to be suffering a loss.That is……This kind of thing shouldn’t be counted as a violation by the system, will it deduct my villain value?
