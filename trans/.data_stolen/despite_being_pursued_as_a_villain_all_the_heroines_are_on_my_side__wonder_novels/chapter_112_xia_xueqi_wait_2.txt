From the moment she chose to back down, the situation was completely out of her control.She could only leave like a lost dog, disappearing without anyone caring.She could only watch Liu Mengning and her beloved man walk into the dream castle that he carefully prepared for her, and ruthlessly and cruelly took away all the romantic surprises that belonged to her.She was still thinking about how she would be moved to hug him in his arms under Mingyuan’s romantic surprise, and how she would take the initiative to kiss him for the first time under the witness of stars and moonlight…What a happy and romantic moment that would have been.But now, those fantasies had really become fantasies.Because, it would be Liu Mengning, not her, who would be moved to snuggle in Mingyuan’s arms.The woman who kissed him under the stars and moonlight would also be Liu Mengning, not her!Obviously all of this should belong to her…But, this woman is still laughing at this time!Still laughing!Xia Xueqi gritted her teeth, her inner pride and stubbornness kept her from falling at this time.Even if you leave the venue, you have to leave beautifully!“Humph! I just don’t want to be too lazy to play this drama with Su Mingyuan, so I wish you… have a good time.”Xueqi turned away contemptuously, with a disdainful look at coexisting with Su Mingyuan, you Liu Mengning came here just so I could get away with an arrogant attitude.But after turning around, her strength and all her disguise collapsed at this moment.No matter how cold she was, it felt painful, and she would also be sad.In front was the dark road where she came from, and in the back, there was a dream playground with bright lights and singing, fluttering balloons and ribbons, waiting for lovers to visit at any time.But, she couldn’t turn back, she could only go forward.Let the light from the rear painting out her lonely shadow, engulfed by the darkness.Lonely, weak, pitiful.Su Mingyuan’s heart couldn’t help aching.Obviously following the character design at this time, he should be ecstatic to take Liu Mengning into the amusement park, but he was too slow to take a step.Just leave Xia Xueqi like this, really… okay?——Then what should Liu Mengning do here?Obviously following the character design was the most reasonable and efficient choice, and it could ensure that the plot would not change drastically in the future.But, she looked so lonely and pitiful…Since she has chosen to give in herself, why don’t you accept this kindness with peace of mind, she will understand you.Peace of mind… make sense?-Be sensible, don’t forget that you’re just an actor! You don’t need to put too much emotion into the rest of the world! Don’t you really fall in love with her!Yes, be more rational, be more rational, I am always afraid that I will have an emotional attachment to this world, and I always remind myself to be rational, not to be too involved with others, and not to have too deep a bond with others.In order to ensure the progress of the plot, in order to get a high rating and a lot of villain points ​​in each performance, I always force myself to calculate the gains and losses rationally.Compared with trying to make them fall in love with Xiao Ran again, I still have to figure out a way to arrange everything before each performance to ensure that nothing goes wrong, which is a thankless endeavour.If you can capture them, it is the best solution once and for all.Why am I hesitating here, why am I letting Xueqi’s concessions instead of holding back?Because my heart is calculating the gains and losses calmly and indifferently, I know that Xueqi will understand me, although she will be very sad, I don’t have much loss.She still has a very good impression of me, and the plot will not collapse too much because of this, so I choose to watch her leave.And if I choose to deviate from the character setting in front of Liu Mengning to keep her here, it will cause a bigger change in the plot, and I need to spend more effort and energy to get it back on track.I’ve always been sane.It doesn’t matter if I say bad acting, but when it comes to things related to the plot and performance, my heart automatically starts to make cold calculations.In the final analysis, it was my sanity and my indifference that made me feel that there was no need for me to keep Xia Xueqi here, but in the end it took more effort to get the plot back on track.Because from a rational point of view, this is not worth the loss.However, humans were not emotionless machines.For some reason, the picture from the previousweek suddenly appeared in his mind.It was a snowy night.Just when Xia Xueqi, with Xiao Ran’s secret help, was about to completely control the Xia family.Her vicious stepmother was finally unable to hold back her ill hands.After all, she was just a weak woman. When people around her saw the right time to attack her, even though she had been prepared, she was still defeated. She was kidnapped by the kidnappers and taken to an abandoned warehouse.That was the poison plan made by all those who opposed her in the Xia family. This was their last counterattack, and they had been planning for a long time.#pleasereadthischapteratfoxaholic.comHowever, what caused Xia Xueqi the most pain and despair was that.Her father, whom she regarded as her greatest support and whom she admired the most, was also involved.The taciturn but still secretly caring father had always been the last safe haven in her heart.
