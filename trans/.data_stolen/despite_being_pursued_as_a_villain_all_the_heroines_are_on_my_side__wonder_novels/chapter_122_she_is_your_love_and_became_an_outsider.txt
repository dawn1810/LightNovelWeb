“Hello, knight… sir.”In the face of Su Mingyuan’s greeting, Xia Xueqi simply held back the cursing words in her throat, and said those words with difficulty.Mingyuan, who still called her Xueqi intimately last night, was now calling her Miss Xia with a cold face?And she had to pretend to cooperate, calling him… Mr. Knight?Even though he is my fiancé and my loyal knight, I still have to call him Mr. Knight!Seeing that, Xia Xueqi’s face became even more pale.In addition, Mingyuan also wrapped his arms around Hongxue’s waist in front of her, with a cold and indifferent attitude as if he never met her.The smile on the corner of Murong Hongxue’s mouth became more and more pleasant.“Xueqi, don’t stand stupidly. Come, sit.”While beckoning Xia Xueqi to sit down, she turned her head and pointed at the sofa, rubbed Su Mingyuan’s face affectionately, and said coquettishly, “Can you hold me and sit down there, my knight?”Good guy!Xia Xueqi couldn’t move the foot she just raised.You, Murong Hongxue, know no bounds, right?However, what shocked and embarrassed her even more was that Su Mingyuan only hesitated for a while, then he really moved and walked towards the sofa with Murong Hongxue in his arms.Moreover, in front of Xueqi!Even when he held Murong Hongxue and passed by her, he didn’t even look at her!Su Mingyuan was unaware that Xia Xueqi knew the person under the mask was him.He thought that Xueqi couldn’t recognize his identity anyway, and Hongxue didn’t know that his real identity was Xueqi’s fiance Su Mingyuan.Then, when he appeared in front of Hongxue as Su Mingyuan, and as a white knight in front of Xueqi, his identity would stay hidden, and they wouldn’t even know that he was actually the white knight they liked (Su Mingyuan).Then, he just needed to do the behaviour that his current identity should have.Now he was a white knight, a stranger to Xia Xueqi, the eldest lady of the Xia family, and Hongxue was his lover.So, wasn’t it natural for him to satisfy the petite request of the person in his arms?Especially when he walked past Xueqi with Hongxue in his arms, the nervousness and the excitement of walking on the tip of the knife, made Su Mingyuan feel a strange pleasure.It was no wonder that in ancient and modern times, both men and women, many people couldn’t help being tempted to go down the road of cheating.He seemed to… have begun to like this kind of gameplay.I’m sorry, Xueqi, it’s not that my will is not firm, but that I have to make such a sacrifice for my great cause of returning home!In the future, I will make sure to compensate you well. How about I have an intimate interaction with you in front of Hongxue as Su Mingyuan, the eldest Young Master of the Su family?Su Mingyuan didn’t know if Xia Xueqi heard it or not, so he said so in his heart, mainly thinking that if there was a chance in the future, he could hold Xueqi in front of Hongxue and do it again.After all, in his opinion, Xueqi didn’t know that the white knight in front of her was him, Su Mingyuan, how could she be really angry?He took a peek at her face, finding it very icy, and very cold.Just like her usual expression when she treated outsiders, it was very in line with the temperament and aura of iceberg beauty.She seems to be a little angry, but the main reason must be Hongxue. After all, she came to have a conversation, but Hongxue left her aside to make out with me and ignore her, right?Su Mingyuan automatically made up the reason why Xia Xueqi was angry at this time.After all, Hongxue’s behaviour just now was indeed a little disrespectful to her.When Su Mingyuan carried Murong Hongxue to the sofa, she still stayed in his arms and refused to leave.With a cold face, Xia Xueqi sat silently opposite the two of them, watching Murong Hongxue pouting in Mingyuan’s arms, saying she wanted to sit in his arms and be held by him like this.Su Mingyuan said to her earnestly that there were still others watching.You invite others to talk about things, but you face them with this attitude, don’t you respect them at all?Only then did Murong Hongxue obediently get down from his arms to sit beside him, but still hugged his arm tightly, refusing to separate with him.And although Su Mingyuan seemed to be pointing at Xia Xueqi and helping her out, but she listened and heard only two words in her ears:Other people.Uh, someone else…I, Xia Xueqi, already am an outsider, right?“Hongxue, we don’t need this gentleman to sit in on the conversation between our sisters.”Xia Xueqi made her last struggle, trying to push Su Mingyuan away.Because, she couldn’t stand it, she couldn’t stand Murong Hongxue being so close to Ming Yuan in front of her.Especially……Murong Hongxue, can you stop touching my Mingyuan like no one else as soon as you sit down?From time to time, she touched his thighs, pinched the muscles on his arms. She looked at him and laughed. While he was not paying attention, she sneaked up to kiss him twice…Do you think I don’t exist?“It’s okay, Xueqi, he’s not an outsider, he’s my love. He knows everything about me, and I don’t have any secrets in front of him, so…”Murong Hongxue finally turned her head, looked her in the eyes, and said seriously,“There is no need to hide the conversation between us.”Xia Xueqi was completely speechless.At that moment, she was even ready to get up and leave.Out of sight, out of mind, she couldn’t stand Murong Hongxue’s sweet and provocative eyes.This woman had one big character written all over her body: Bad!You want to be intimate with Mingyuan, right?Then I will wait until you are close enough.No, how could you be so successful?The corner of Xia Xueqi’s mouth evoked a sneer.Just wait, Murong Hongxue, as soon as I go out, I will make dozens or hundreds of phone calls to him as my fiancée, as Mingyuan’s lover.However, before she could stand up to say goodbye and leave, Su Mingyuan couldn’t take it anymore and stood up abruptly.He really didn’t expect that he would feel such great excitement in this kind of cheating situation.Murong Hongxue’s subtle provocation were bearable in the past, and it wouldn’t make him mad enough to stand up.But in such a situation, those tiny stimuli and tiny flames were suddenly magnified and detonated exponentially.He was a little… unbearable.If Xia Xueqi wasn’t here, he wouldn’t bear it any longer, and ask Hongxue to help him solve it.But now that Xueqi was present, it was impossible to do such a thing in front of her!They were facing each other now, and there was no obstruction in the middle. There was no tablecloth to block the deed, and it was impossible for Hongxue to secretly help him under the tablecloth…If he was teased by Hongxue like this, he would really lose his temper in front of the two girls!Su Mingyuan had no choice but to stand up and take Murong Hongxue’s hand to the corner.“Hongxue, come with me, I have something to tell you.”He decided to finish talking about the purpose of the trip, and leave.If he stayed any longer, the flames couldn’t really be extinguished!At that time, Murong Hongxue didn’t know that she was going too far. Instead, she pushed Su Mingyuan out, smiling and letting him hold her hands. When passing by Xia Xueqi, she even threw a bright smile at her.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernoveles.comXia Xueqi was expressionless, but her hand on her knee unconsciously grabbed the corner of the skirt and clenched it tightly.Mingyuan actually took the initiative to pull Murong Hongxue to speak.Just when she was in a very unhappy mood, a sharp and angry voice suddenly came from outside the door.“Murong Hongxue! You must tell me today! My dignified young master of the Xia family went to play with women at your place, but do you know what your subordinates did yesterday? She even arranged for me…”The shrill voice stopped abruptly. Xia Rongze looked at the woman who stood up from the sofa and turned around. With a terrified expression, he shouted tremblingly, “……sister?”Xia Xueqi folded her arms around her chest and stared coldly at the uninvited Xia Rongze. The anger accumulated in her heart for a long time immediately found a target to vent.—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
