Su Xuelan never expected that Xia Xueqi would come to visit suddenly at this time.According to her information, Xia Xueqi and Murong Hongxue fought enthusiastically.She was thinking of taking advantage of the rivalry between these two women in order to win her brother in one fell swoop.Surprisingly, this vixen sensed Mingyuan’s smell within a few minutes after his return.Upon seeing Xia Xueqi’s appearance, she had an instantaneous bad feeling.Moreover, Xia Xueqi came with ulterior purposes.Why so?As Su Mingyuan’s fiancee who had been attentive to him despite her hectic schedule, learnt that Su Mingyuan took Ruoruo to Liu Mengning this morning and then went home alone.Such abnormal behaviour suddenly made Xia Xueqi feel a little weird.When she learned from Liu Mengning that Su Mingyuan was going home for a few days, she assumed it was Su Xuelan, the bad woman who used her position as a sister to force Mingyuan to stay.At home, she could use this opportunity to engage in some despicable and obscene behaviour with Mingyuan.If she only thought about that scene, Xia Xueqi would be a little unhappy at most, and she would not be in a hurry to catch up with the door.But, as a good sister, she never underestimated Su Xuelan.The strange feeling in her heart also made her feel that things were not so simple.She tried to imagine what she would do if she were Su Xuelan, in order to win Mingyuan back from those bad women and from Xia Xueqi, who was exceptionally intelligent?Let’s just say that she was a good sister with a deep understanding of her brother.At that moment, Xia Xueqi suddenly realized what a malicious idea Su Xuelan had hidden beneath the surface of letting Mingyuan go home for a few days.This vicious woman intended to exploit her parents!Damn it!She had already guessed what Su Xuelan would do in the past few days.Constantly engage in more and more intimate physical contact with Mingyuan, intentionally or unintentionally, provoke him, tease him, and wait for the right time to show him that she did not actually treat him as a younger brother but as a man.At the same time, she would exploit her parents, saying that although she was not their blood daughter, she had already accepted them as her parents in her heart, and if she and Mingyuan could become a real couple, then they would also become a real family…ViciousIt was too vicious!Now, Xia Xueqi had infinite confidence in winning this Shura field because her fiancée status gave her the most confidence!However, if Su Xuelan’s plan was successful, Su Xuelan’s father and mother would be aware that she was their preferred daughter-in-law.Perhaps, for the sake of Su Xuelan, the Su family’s parents would approach the Xia family and propose that they call off their marriage. Not only would her identity as Mingyuan’s fiancee would be dissolved by that time, but Su Xuelan, with the backing of her parents, would be able to completely sway Mingyuan’s opinion. If she did not want him to get close to other women, they would need to stay at their hands.She did not care what type of rival Liu Mengsing was.However, Su Xuelan was attempting to eradicate the problem by digging out its roots!Therefore, Xia Xueqi had no time to manage the group of staff that Xiao Ran had recently assigned her. She hurriedly sent gifts to Su’s residence.Why would she spend her time now fighting for the Xia family’s power? If she didn’t hurry up, Su Xuelan would cover the sky with one hand and dominate Mingyuan for the rest of her life!Only this matter, Xia Xueqi would not tolerate it.When Xia Xueqi entered the door, although Su Xuelan was smiling on the surface and looked extremely dignified and gentle like a noble. But, she was deeply unhappy in her heart, and she had the uneasy feeling that Xia Xueqi’s visit didn’t have good intentions, and she was up to some evil scheme.“Hello, Auntie, hello Xuelan, and Mingyuan.” Xia Xueqi politely greeted the three of them.Although she appeared cold and arrogant in front of others, when she was in front of Su Mu, her demeanour was much softer. She had a faint smile on her face which didn’t look cold, but rather it would remind people of the beautiful snow lotus on Tianshan mountain rangeAlthough Mother Su was a little puzzled, she still smiled kindly at Xia Xueqi and greeted her with a few words.She remembered that Xia Xueqi’s face wasn’t welcoming to other people at the engagement banquet, so she could tell that she wasn’t happy with the engagement.After that, although she would greet her occasionally at the banquet, her tone was also cold, and she had never visited them on her own initiative, but now she looked so gentle…Mother Su couldn’t help but want to rub her eyes, wondering if she was wrong.Is this the cold and arrogant child of the Xia family?The next scene surprised her even more.Because after greeting Su Mingyuan, Xia Xueqi actually took the initiative to walk towards him with a smile, hugged him, and greeted him in a gentle voice in his ear.Their natural and intimate appearanceIf they said they weren’t dating, no one would believe them!Mother Su was stunned.Before this, knowing that Xia Xueqi was dissatisfied with this engagement, she could understand.Xia Xueqi was so pretty, proud, cold, and smart, but she had to marry her son…Even though Mother Su thought that her son could be forgiven no matter what bad things he had done. He was just a little bit naughty, and he had a flamboyant personality because he had not yet achieved his objectives.But she also knew her son’s virtue, and Xueqi was justifiably angry about their engagement.This was why Su Xuelan was able to convince her.Who knew how many disputes might arise between Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi after their marriage, given that she was unwilling and possessed a strong and arrogant personality?It was better to let her daughter Xuelan and Mingyuan become a real couple. With her doting on Mingyuan, he would never be wronged.It was out of consideration of the happiness of her son’s future marriage that Mother Su reluctantly suppressed her rejection and accepted this statement.But now.Mother Su could tell at a glance that the hug between Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi was intimate and not pretentious. It could not be faked.The most important thing was that the eyes couldn’t deceive people.Whether it was the way her son looked at Xueqi, or the way she looked at him, the relationship between the two…Mother Su suddenly hesitated.Su Xuelan was gnashing her teeth nearby.She and Mingyuan just hugged each other briefly, but now Xia Xueqi was not only embracing Mingyuan in front of her, but the two were whispering to each other while doing the same. Mingyuan’s embrace was filled with the scent of this coquettish bithch, his reddish cheeks, the way he looked at her…Seeing this scene, Su Xuelan’s lungs would explode!Fortunately, Su Mingyuan also felt that it was embarrassing to be so intimate with Xueqi in front of his mother, so he let go not long after, and took her by hand into the living room.At that time, Xia Xueqi hurriedly asked the driver to bring over gifts in large and small packages, all of which were high-quality goods for beauty. Mother Su did not refuse, and accepted them with a smile. Although she had some doubts, she was not in a hurry.Xia Xueqi took her hand and sat down next to her, praising her for her youth and beauty. Outsiders might mistake her for her older sister, and she introduced the effect of the gift she brought.After that, she said, “Auntie, it will make you look younger and more radiant.”
