When the rest of the Xia family oppressed and accused her, he was the only one who would stand up to protect her.But, no matter how good a father was, he couldn’t resist the deaf ears of the people next to him.A pro-daughter, after all, couldn’t equal a pro-son.Without her father’s secret acquiescence, the plot would not have succeeded and she would not have been kidnapped.The abandoned warehouse surrounded by ice and snow seemed to be an island.She was a shivering little lamb trapped on an isolated island, abandoned by her relatives, surrounded by severe cold wind and snow, and threatened by a hunter with a gun pointed at her.Her father’s abandonment finally became the last thorn to pierce her heart, and the hard and cold iceberg completely collapsed at this moment.She knew, she had always known that although her father had been secretly protecting her. He also hoped that she would be obedient and that he would marry that trash Su Mingyuan.She knew that he didn’t want her to be too good, and he hoped that she could take the initiative to give way to her younger brother Xia Rongze.Although he was protecting her, he was just telling those people not to overdo it.He would never resist all the pressure and accusations from the family for her. He hoped that one day she would retreat under this kind of pressure and choose to accept her fate.But, she didn’t want to, she didn’t want to accept her fate, she didn’t want her life to be arranged by others like this, and she didn’t want to be a manipulated marionette.So, as long as it was good enough to be dazzling, it was fine, right?As long as she could show enough skills, she could bring the Xia family to gain more power and benefits, no one would object, right?Father…I don’t think I’m inferior to Xia Rongze.I should just obey and accept my fate and marry Su Mingyuan, right?But, she did not expect that when most of the Xia family had silently accepted her leadership, her father would acquiesce to the poisonous plan secretly planned by her stepmother.He only wanted her to be his obedient daughter, and she shouldn’t disobey her parents’ orders again and again.It turned out that he was no different from those people.Xia Xueqi’s state of mind was almost collapsed at that time, her eyes were dazed and grey, when the kidnappers threatened her to sign each document and asked her to hand over all the power in her hands.Her heart had almost fallen into the abyss of darkness and despair.Everyone was looking forward to her becoming the obedient vase princess of the family, a marionette at their mercy, even her dearest and most respected father…Should I accept my fate?I can’t, don’t I deserve the freedom to choose my own life?Bang!At this moment, Su Mingyuan was wearing a white knight suit while wielding a magical weapon, and descended from the sky. He simply turned over all the kidnappers neatly, and stretched out his hand towards her, “Hey,Xia Xueqi, didn’t you say that you would rather be a rebellious princess who pursues freedom, than a vase that is constantly praised and admired but has a gorgeous appearance?What about your rebellious spirit?”Xia Xueqi raised her dull eyes, “My father…, he also… wants me to be an obedient vase for others to admire.”“Hey, I thought it was a big deal. He wants you to be a vase and you have to do what he wants? Please, are you doing all this to gain his approval, or to pursue your own life? And chose rebellion? Wake up, my rebellious princess!”Su Mingyuan patted her face.“He wants you to be a vase, and he wants to arrange your life, so you can’t do what he wants! You should go back and regroup, recapture the Xia family, and let those who want to arrange and manipulate your life crawl in your place. Under your feet, let those who looked down on you in the past have to look up desperately to see you, let your father, your stepmother, and your younger brother, let them all regret what they did to you!”Xia Xueqi’s eyes gradually brightened.The cold and arrogant temperament returned to her again.Yes, she was a rebellious princess and a high iceberg. She wanted to go back to regroup and regain power. She wanted those people to crawl under her feet and look up at her.She wanted them to.. regret what they had done!At this moment, the Iceberg Queen was back again, because she had found a spiritual support that warmed her even more in her heart.She smiled at him and asked, “Will you still help me this time, white knight?”“Certainly.”Su Mingyuan knelt down halfway like a real knight without feeling ashamed at all, took the back of her hand, smiled, kissed and saluted, “I am your most loyal knight, my dear rebellious princess, always.”As always, always… the same?At that time, he was not ashamed to say those words at all, and only thought that it was funny, but when he thought about it at that moment, he didn’t know why his chest hurted a little.“Su Mingyuan, won’t you accompany me in?Or…”At that moment, Liu Mengning came over with a smile, tilted her head and looked at him curiously, as if warning, but also reminding.“…Do you want to chase her back?”Xia Xueqi’s figure was soon going to disappear into the darkness of the road ahead. It was the end of the abyss that seemed to be endless and only darkness loomed there.Once he fell from the sky as a white knight when she was desperate and heartbroken, but now?Can I just stand by now?Su Mingyuan’s heart suddenly dropped.Reason was telling him to be calm at this time, and not make irrational choices. The optimal solution was already in front of him, and he couldn’t be blinded by such unnecessary feelings!But……But, ah.Why was there so many props and costumes in the mall, and she fell in love with the white knight’s suit at a glance?Why after putting on the mask, he could say those heroic choreography words without any scruples?He was the actor Su Mingyuan and the white knight Su Mingyuan.He was not on the show now, he didn’t need to play the villainous and arrogant villain Su Mingyuan.He just needed to follow his heart!Even if the character design was broken in front of Liu Mengning, and he needed to spend more energy to recover the plot, so what?Letting girls get hurt and cry was never the style of a white knight!“Xueqi, wait!”He left Liu Mengning without hesitation and ran towards the lonely Xia Xueqi.Xia Xueqi stopped.
