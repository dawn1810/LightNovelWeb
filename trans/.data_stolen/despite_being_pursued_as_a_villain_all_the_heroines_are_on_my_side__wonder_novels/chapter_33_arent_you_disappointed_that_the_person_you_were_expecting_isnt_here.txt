“Heh, hypocrite.”Xia Xueqi put down the phone and sent the driver a location while sneering.“You don’t want Su Mingyuan to be taken advantage of by an unknown woman, and you don’t want to be the one to ruin his good mood.  You’ve taken all the benefits, right?”“Not only that, I also know that you want to be a oriole. You’re just waiting for me to ruin Su Mingyuan’s good mood and make a scene with him so that you can take the opportunity to come out and earn his goodwill, right?”“At that time, I’ll become a bad woman who ruined Su Mingyuan’s plans. You’re the good sister who supported him and protected him. Huh, Su Xuelan, do you think I don’t know what you’re planning?”After being schemed against by Su Xuelan like this, Xia Xueqi did not look angry at all.“Hehe, Su Xuelan, don’t forget, when I hung up, I said that I would give you a surprise.”A smile suddenly appeared on her ice-cold face. It appeared like a blossoming cold and beautiful snow lotus flower at the summit of the Snow Mountain.Beautiful, yet cold.Su Mingyuan happily sat in his Rolls Royce and even started humming.‘When your mood is low and you are in deep depression, you must not fall into this kind of mood and not be able to walk out.’‘Go find something that would make you happy.’‘Despair and grief alone could not change the current situation. Perhaps if you are optimistic, you can find a solution to the problem.’This was what Su Mingyuan had done.That was right. Xia Xueqi had indeed dealt a great blow to him this morning. She had even made him feel despair and wanted to give up.But despair was temporary, optimism was eternal.Su Mingyuan was never someone who was easily defeated by despair.Maintaining enthusiasm and optimism forever was the secret to his success in saving 100,000 counter-attacks last week.Now, after a warm kiss with Ruoruo and the thought of a date later, his mood had long since risen from his initial pessimism.Furthermore, when he thought of the plot of his upcoming appearance, he was in an even better mood.Because the conflict between him and Xiao Ran happened in a high-end bar.Most importantly, no other female leads appeared in this conflict!A few days later, Xiao Ran brought them to a bar in the highest end of the capital to entertain his mercenaries and assassins from abroad. Then, he happened to run into Su Mingyuan, who came to drink and play with women.After some face-smacking, Xiao Ran’s actions were reported to the owner of the bar, Murong Hongxue, the underground queen of Mingjing City. He successfully attracted her attention.But that was already after the end of the plot related to Su Mingyuan.So…Although Xia Xueqi had caused the main line to change, Su Mingyuan had yet to figure out how to fix it.However, on the bright side, at least the next time he appears, the female leads won’t be able to make trouble for him.He, as well as the Xiao Ran whom he was still familiar with, would definitely be able to cooperate well and perform without any flaws.Although Su Mingyuan hadn’t received a good system evaluation the previous two times, it was clear that this third time, he wouldn’t have any problems!Moreover, he could relax during the few days that he didn’t need to perform.Taking advantage of his status as a wealthy young man and enjoying a short and pleasant vacation with the beautiful girl was not a bad idea.In terms of looks, temperament, and charm, those girls were definitely inferior to the female lead in Ruoruo’s novel.But he could only see it, he couldn’t eat it.Soon, the Rolls Royce stopped at the entrance of a luxurious and low-key restaurant in Mingjing.“Sir, may I ask who you are?”“I have an appointment, number 33.”“Okay, please come with me.”Su Mingyuan followed the waiter’s instructions and walked towards the predetermined position.The restaurant was reserved for the lady who was chatting on the software.It could be seen that she had chosen a very careful place.The restaurant had elegant decorations everywhere. Every decoration made people feel a unique sense of art. It was elegant and not crowded.In a corner of the restaurant, there was a pianist slowly playing a soothing and melodious tune. Beside the restaurant was a small lake with beautiful scenery.The guests by the window could enjoy the beautiful scenery by the lake while listening to the melodious music.As expected, the girl on the mysterious software didn’t disappoint him. She was rather tactful.When communicating with girls like this, the process would obviously make people feel even happier.Number 33 was by the window.The girl on the app didn’t use the privilege of being a woman. She arrived early on purpose and sat quietly on her seat, waiting for him. She left him a good side face covered with a layer of golden halo by the sun.‘When you’re rich enough to make countless women flock to you, you don’t have to worry about girls being late for dates.’‘Because they would always be the ones waiting for you first.’Su Mingyuan wasn’t in a hurry to walk over. Instead, he stood aside and quietly enjoyed the beautiful scenery.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThis girl’s face was very pure and beautiful. It made people think of their first love at first glance, but her figure didn’t look like a young girl at all.She seemed to know her own characteristics, so the pure white dress and white shoes made her look even more pure and beautiful.But at the same time, she deliberately used a white belt around her waist, perfectly highlighting her full and alluring chest.In addition, her dress was also very particular. The long and thin sling made her smooth and thin shoulder perfectly exposed. The collarbone that was faintly exposed had a trace of seductive charm, and the short hem of the dress could just reveal her slender calf that was wrapped in white silk.She was pure, beautiful, and charming.‘Very good. It seemed like she understood very well.’Su Mingyuan nodded in satisfaction and walked over.When he would be in bed with this beautiful girl, he would definitely enjoy a lot of happiness.Su Mingyuan thought with anticipation.He felt that he was simply lucky. Although he only saw the side of her face, her appearance, temperament, and outfit.It made him feel that the girl in front of him was not weaker than any other female lead. He even felt as if he had seen her before.‘Only……’‘Does this girl have poor photography skills?’‘If not, why does she look a million times better than the photos in the software?’‘I don’t know why, but at this moment, I suddenly have a bad premonition in my heart.Su Mingyuan sat opposite the girl.As soon as he sat down, the girl turned to look at him with a cold, contemptuous smile on her face.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAt this moment, what pure temperament, what seductive figure, in front of this icy smile, he was suddenly suppressed under the iceberg and no longer existed.The girl regained her original temperament.Su Mingyuan finally saw the girl’s face at this moment, and his face changed greatly, etching with fear second by second.When Xia Xueqi saw his face change in an instant, the faint smile on her cold pretty face rose slightly by a few margins.“Aren’t you disappointed that the person you were expecting isn’t here?”“Su Mingyuan.”***
