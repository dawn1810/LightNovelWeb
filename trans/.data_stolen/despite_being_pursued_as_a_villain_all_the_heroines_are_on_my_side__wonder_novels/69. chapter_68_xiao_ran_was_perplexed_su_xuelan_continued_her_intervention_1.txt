Under the sunny street, Su Mingyuan walked in a good mood.He didn’t care about the strange eyes cast by the pedestrians in the street right now.When he put on these clothes for the first time in a very long time, he felt a little uncomfortable. He wore this outfit for so many things last week, couldn’t he get used to being the centre of attention?Most importantly, Murong Hongxue was successfully persuaded by him!Next, he would have nothing to do for the next two days if Xiao Ran’s side remains idle.He didn’t have to worry about that loser any more!It was at this same moment that Su Li called him and informed him that he had finished all of the things that he had requested.This was the errand that he had given to his subordinates before going out, and they were done so quickly.Su Li’s work ability and level were worthy of his trust!…………Inside the spacious and bright office.Xiao Ran frowned tightly, and his mood was not very good.Despite the fact that he had already chosen the company’s address, which was the building he had purchased. Along with that, he also had the company registered.However……… if the company did not develop, it would be pointless for him to go through such troubles.If the invested money could not generate revenue and attract other powerful and rich people, it was merely a string of numbers that could not be converted into power.Of course, in addition to the security company under his name, he was also preparing to open an entertainment company.Although China’s powers were exclusionary, and he could not penetrate the energy and power industry, mining, pharmaceuticals, machinery manufacture, and real estate,  there was a circle that would never refuse foreign capital.Film industry!And those who were wealthy and powerful, no matter how powerful, were intricately bound to this word.Sex.Through the entertainment company, he could easily hook up with the powerful, whether they want money or women.And his security company served as the foundation for strengthening and securing these mutually beneficial ties.When these people would not be able live without his personal security, his money, or his beauty deals, wouldn’t it mean his network of power is slowly gaining strength?But now he was in big trouble.Since he got back last night, he had sent people over and over again to find Murong Hongxue to try to make peace, but he hadn’t heard back from them.This company was already established and the building was already bought, but his business had not started up for a long time, so he was extremely anxious!At this time, one of his brothers named Nick knocked on the door and barged in.“A man in white suit came to the door of the company just now. He requested us to send you a message, and then asked me to hand you this note. He also showed me an amazing Chinese martial art that you, boss, have! It’s simply incredible!”Xiao Ran was stunned, took the note and asked, “What message did he ask you to bring me?”“He said…… he knew the boss’s difficult situation, so he went to speak directly to Murong Hongxue and gave you the chance to negotiate and seek peace..  At ten o’clock tomorrow morning, Murong Hongxue will be waiting for you at the Fairview Building. ”What the!Xiao Ran’s eyes trembled, and his heart shook even more.Who is this mysterious man in white!Why does he know what he wants to do, his predicament, and, most incredible of all, he persuaded Murong Hongxue to give him a chance to make peace?#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comKnowing he needed to follow the ancient custom, he had people send over a dozen sealed appointment letters to Murong Hongxue, but she ignored them!And listening to what Nick just said, he also knew …… martial arts?Xiao Ran hurriedly unfolded the note, only to see two lines written on it:Heavenly CreationImmortal Master Li WuyaAt this moment, Xiao Ran’s pupils trembled and he was completely confused.Because these two lines simply touched his heart’s deepest secret.Whether it was the Heavenly Creation of Pure Jade Divine skill, or the name on the note.Because this name was clearly the name of the old monk he met when he was ten years old!Ruoruo’s illness was cured by him, and this improved version of his own radiant jade divine skill was also created by him, but now someone actually knew about this!Who is he?Is he a friend or foe?Xiao Ran hurriedly asked Nick, “Have you seen what he looks like?”“He was wearing a white coat and a mask on his face, the kind we wore on our faces when we attended the Masquerade Ball on Halloween, covering only a circle around his eyes. I can’t see what he really looks like, but he does look really cool, and he can do amazing martial arts,” Nick said in an exaggerated tone.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com“Don’t know what he looks like ……” Xiao Ran said in a despondent tone.At this moment, he really wanted to meet this mysterious man in white mask.He had too many questions in his mind!But in terms of his attitude and what he did, at least he was kind to him.But who exactly is he?Could it be one of the children from the old orphanage?Xiao Ran frowned and racked his brains into contemplation.Su Mingyuan didn’t know at this time that Xiao Ran was in a state of confusion, and he couldn’t calm down for a long time. Even when he went to bed at night, he still thought about him. He tossed and turned all night and couldn’t sleep well .Su Mingyuan’s current thoughts were that he had just barely resolved the plot, settled a major incident, and was in a very good mood.As he walked down the street, he noticed that even the whistling wind of hot summer had become much more refreshing.What should he do next in his free time?As he walked across a footbridge, he suddenly heard the sound of a guitar drifting from above.A street performer, or a wandering singer? He was playing and singing with a guitar in his hands, attracting many pedestrians to stop and listen, and there were sporadic people who put money into the wooden box in front of him. He earned money based on ability, which was not bad.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe melody of the guitar was rather delightful, and the singing was quite pleasant.Of course, in the ears of Su Mingyuan, who was a master, the music and singing seemed a bit too mediocre. Not only were there no bright spots, but also mistakes and omissions could be found everywhere.However, he also intended not to stand up and criticise others, nor dis he intend to seize other people’s guitars to demonstrate to him what it meant to be a master.So he just stood a few steps away and didn’t say anything. Then he turned around and got ready to leave.At this moment, a homeless person with a foul smell suddenly appeared from the crowd, rushed to the wandering singer, picked up the wooden box containing his money, and ran.Su Mingyuan couldn’t bear it.
