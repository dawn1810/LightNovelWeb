Su Mingyuan never tried to tell other people in reality those Wen Qing sentences that were deliberately written in his diary.Even when wearing a white knight suit.That was a bit too shameful.And he felt that he himself was not so suitable for sensationalism.But at this moment, under the contrast of the atmosphere, under the gaze of MurongHongxue’s shy and eager eyes.He couldn’t help but remember the sentences he wrote in the diary last week, and then he couldn’t help but say these words himself.The effect is outstanding!Murong Hongxue immediately hugged him in a moving hug and offered him a warm and lingering kiss.Those who could only read Mingyuan’s inner monologue in his previous life could only read it through his diary, but he said it so truthfully at this moment.How could Murong Hongxue not be excited?How could she not be moved?She waited for this moment for too long!“My knight…”Her charming face pressed against his hot cheeks; Her slightly open red lips gently touched his earlobe, and she exhaled gently in his ear,“I seem to have… fallen in love with you.”Boom!At this moment, this sentence had become thebest catalyst, completely igniting the hearts of the two.“My knight, you don’t seem quite satisfied…”“Actually, I too…”Feeling the strange emotion being held back by something from her lower abdomen, Murong Hongxue smiled shyly and emotionally. The words she said softly and her next actions caused Su Mingyuan to fall completely in the next moment.“…But don’t worry, Hongxue will soon make you more comfortable.”Her hands descended slowly, helping him to untie.Then she opened her legs slightly to reveal a gap, and after they pressed them tightly. Ehe couldn’t help but let out a shy moan, and then closed the pair of plump, firm, smooth and elastic thighs, letting him drown into her completely.Su Mingyuan could never imagine that Murong Hongxue could achieve such a level.This progress was too fast, this was the second time they met!But Murong Hongxue felt that the progress was a bit slow.She was just a flower that had rotted in the filthy silt. If it wasn’t for him to illuminate her, she would never be able to show her charming beauty.Therefore, she never dared to expect too much, and dared not expect to occupy all his emotions.She was just a humble and twisted bad woman. She was not worthy to be the white moonlight in his heart.So even if she could only be his underground lover, she was willing.But even as a lover, if she dared not have the love that occupied her, can’t she expect the pleasure of his flesh?So if she has the opportunity, she would definitely seize it.She just wanted to go further with him, and further, and further.Until there was no barrier between the two of them.“My knight, um~, is it comfortable…?”Murong Hongxue gave him a deep kiss and then took the initiative to start moving. She murmured alluringly and looked at him with coquettish eyes. Accompanied by the explosive stimulation of her senses, she instantly brought him a supreme feeling. enjoy.Fuck, fuck, fuck!At this moment, Su Mingyuan didn’t carewhether the progress was fast or slow.He had been completely cool to the extreme, and his calmness and rationality had been completely thrown out of the window.Short of breath, flushed face, blurred eyes.He had completely fallen into the gentle territory of Murong Hongxue.The goodwill towards her in his heart was rising explosively.Because… this was something that even Ruoruo had never done before!But he, under the body of Murong Hongxue, the seductive and charming female goblin like concubine Su, perfectly experienced an unparalleled joy.Who could refuse such a bad woman?Who could resist falling in love with such a bad woman?In the end, Su Mingyuan shamefully sprinkled it on Murong Hongxue’s legs, above the skirt.It was not until he entered the time of the sage that he came back to his senses, and then instantly felt a great shame.He, the white knight Su Mingyuan, is a big man who stands above the rest.Murong Hongxue was slammed against the wall by force, and she was pressed under his body. She was teased until she was panting hot breaths, and her eyes were wet with pleasure.How could he pretend to be a high-ranking person in front of her? Isn’t this completely unbearable and completely stupid!He didn’t even dare to look at Murong Hongxue’s charming eyes, and wanted to run away in shame.At least at this moment, as a man, his last dignity must not be lost!“That, Hongxue, I… I still have something to do, I’ll go first, we’ll see you next time when you’re free.”Su Mingyuan lifted his trousers and was about to slip away.His cheeks were still red and hot now. If he stayed any longer and continued to meet those charming eyes, he didn’t know how embarrassed he would feel.Escape was shameful, but useful!“Knight, are you just leaving?” Murong Hongxue looked at him with some reluctance.Su Mingyuan hummed, didn’t even look at her, turned around and walked away, looking no different from a ruthless, scumbag man.#pleasereadthischapteratWONDERNOVELS.COMSeeing his embarrassed appearance, Murong Hongxue knew that she couldn’t keep pressing it any longer.It’s a pity that I didn’t make it one step at a time today.But she got enough, so it was time to be content.Additionally, after that, she could ask her white knight out through the mysterious software, right?She gently took his hand, and finally bit her lower lip reluctantly, and muttered, “Knight, as long as you want, you can come to Hongxue at any time. You are the light that illuminates me and the person I love. Hongxue is willing to give everything for you.”Hello!Don’t you just say these words at this time to make me feel more moved and embarrassed?Su Mingyuan tried his best to restrain the fluctuations in his heart, replied indifferently“Okay”, and immediately turned into a white shadow and hurriedly disappeared in Lingxue Pavilion.God, shouldn’t he be bullying Murong Hongxue here?Why does it seem to be the other way around, he had become the passive one?But if there is a next time…Damn it!Just thinking of this, the shame that surged up inside made Su Mingyuan slap him hard in his heart.I am a man who stands above the ground, how can I think of being pressed under the body by a woman to…I should be on the conquering side, I should take the initiative!I’m the one who should be on top!Because of shame, Su Mingyuan failed to fast-forward to the last step with Murong Hongxue.It was also because of shame that even if Ruoruo had already started to use her hands and slowly let go, she had always been shy and did not dare to have the final union with him.No wonder Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden by a furious God after they ate the forbidden fruit and learned what shame was.#pleasereadthischapteratWONDERNOVELS.COMIt turned out that knowing shame was, in a sense, a source of evil that hindered human progress!Fortunately, Su Mingyuan and Murong Hongxue didn’t make it to the last step.Otherwise, maybe they were just about to start, they would be seen by someone who comes to visit, and then interrupted on the spot.That was earlier.Burning Flame Building, this was the name Xiao Ran took for the building he bought for his company, implying his unquenchable heart of revenge.And just as Su Mingyuan had just left and Xia Xueqi had just arrived, she had a discussion with Xiao Ran about the film and television company he was going to open, and was about to leave the Ranyan Building.On the way to see him off, Xiao Ran looked at Xia Xueqi, who had a pretty face and a cold face beside her, looked at her slender hands that fell beside her waist and swayed slightly. Thinking about the experiences of the two of them these days, and her support and trust in him as always…***
