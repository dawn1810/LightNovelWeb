Today, I, Su Mingyuan, will turn over to be the master and revive the majesty of men!What iceberg beauty, what aloof female president?Ah!Wasn’t it because of my repeated attacks that she was compelled to let go of her defence, and her face turned red from blushing, while her heart beat danced chaotically?Seeing Xia Xueqi’s blushing and shy face, Su Mingyuan felt so awesome that he couldn’t help but want to laugh up to the sky.Hahaha, bad woman, who told you to always use your imposing aura and words to suppress me.Now it seems that, whether it was the last time or this date, the one who failed miserably in the end was you!“Mingyuan you…”At this time, Xia Xueqi finally endured her shyness and made a sound.She seemed to want to harden her voice and warn him in her usual icy, intimidating tone.But, under Su Mingyuan’s upper and lower attack, the voice from her lips and teeth turned out to be a soft and coquettish whisper, which made Su Mingyuan even more joyful of the conquest.“What am I? Xueqi, why can’t you even speak completely now?”That’s it?“By the way, since you don’t have the strength to hold your phone, let me take pictures for you.”He took out his mobile phone, turned on the camera, clicked a few times, and recorded the appearance of Xia Xueqi in his arms.“Don’t worry, I’ll send these photos to you later. And I will definitely keep them well, watch them from time to time, and always remember your charming and seductive look! Hahahaha!”Su Mingyuan smiled brightly and happily. At this moment, he didn’t use any acting skills, he was already completely like an evil villain.There would always be some negative and dark emotions in people; everyone had them.Even an optimistic person like Su Mingyuan was no exception.In front of Xia Xueqi, Su Mingyuan could use his villain nature to release these negative emotions at will, and after gaining the upper hand through this invisible confrontation, he vented them all out on her.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comOne word could describe his current state.So cool!No matter how cold Xia Xueqi was in front of others, she was so shy and charming in his arms, and he took pictures and saved them on his phone.In the future, this would serve as the evidence that he could take out at will to slap her in the face!It was a pity that because of that rule, he couldn’t get more.Otherwise, he still wanted to slowly move the hand on Xia Xueqi’s waist up or down, or even…Su Mingyuan’s wandering gazes fell on Xia Xueqi’s plump and arrogant towering chest that was about to burst out from the fabric. Her snow-white and tender thighs, and the place between the two beautiful legs that hid a paradise.He immediately looked back.Cough, Cough.He was not that shameless.He would definitely not do that kind of thing without Xia Xueqi’s consent.He was actually a good man with a good heart!And when he slowed down like this, Xia Xueqi seemed to be able to muster up some strength to escape from his embrace.She moved her body with difficulty to escape from Su Mingyuan’s arms, took a small sip of the cold water, looked at Su Mingyuan’s smile with embarrassment, and said with a look of disgust, “Su Mingyuan, if you use your shameless and indecent behaviour in business talks and disputes, I will look at you highly. But, now you will only use these inexperienced tricks to deal with me, a woman. Cut it.”If she still had a cold face as usual, and spoke to Su Mingyuan in such a serious and dignified tone, it might make him feel angry again.But, at this moment, although she tried her best to look disgusted and disdainful, she even called Su Mingyuan’s name in a hurry and forgot to pretend.However, after being teased by Su Mingyuan, her voice softened, and she was blushing heavily like an anime character.In short.Su Mingyuan was not only annoyed at all, on the contrary, he was relieved!This time, Xia Xueqi simply sat across from him as if she was afraid of him doing something wrong.The two of them hadn’t even started ordering food yet!This date had only just begun, and Su Mingyuan had completely defeated Xia Xueqi, smashing the hard iceberg shield she usually wrapped around herself to the ground.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com“Xueqi, are you just gonna sit there? Aren’t you going to take some intimate photos with me? If it’s just a few photos, I’m afraid it will not be convincing enough.”He looked at Xia Xueqi across the table, his eyes full of aggression.Xia Xueqi raised her head and gave him another annoyed look. In Su Mingyuan’s view, she was an ice cold beauty, and he wanted to conquer her more and more.“Let’s talk after dinner!”“Alright, let’s finish eating, let’s talk after that.”Su Mingyuan did not continue chasing her. He knew that he couldn’t push her too hastily, and he must maintain a slow and steady rhythm, so that he could slowly and completely grasp her in the palm of his hand.If he always suppressed and forced the other party to surrender, it would only make the other party anxious.He and Xia Xueqi picked up the menu on the table and casually discussed what to order.Just after the discussion, he happened to see a waiter with a tray passing by, so he quickly stopped the other party and shouted, “Waiter, order!”He shouted a little loudly, as if to startle the other party.The waiter, who hurriedly turned around, was a little confused, and the tray in his hand shook.Although the wine glass on the tray did not fall, the wine inside splashed out of the glass.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comSome were sprinkled on the ground, and some were sprinkled on Su Mingyuan’s clothes.“Sir, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”The waiter panicked and apologised again and again. The panicked look was almost the same as that of Li Shuang that night.There was not much water on the clothes, only a little.It was also impossible for Su Mingyuan to pursue and scold the other party because of this small mistake. It was for performance that night, and now it was not needed.So he picked up the tissue on the table and wiped it, waved to the panicked waiter and said, “It’s alright, don’t be so nervous, now, this is the dish we ordered. You can ask the back kitchen to prepare it quickly.”“Okay, I remember, thank you sir for your forgiveness, thank you sir.” The waiter wiped his sweat and left with repeated thanks.Su Mingyuan didn’t take this trivial matter to heart.But, when he turned his head and met Xia Xueqi’s half-smiling eyes, he suddenly realised something, and a word instantly appeared in his mind, Fuck!Sure enough, Xia Xueqi rested her chin on her hand, her beautiful eyes fixed on him without blinking, and she smiled. “Mingyuan, it’s so strange that the waiter accidentally spilled water on you just now, and you accepted his apology without caring at all. But, why did you grab someone for the same thing that night? The little girl was even forced to accompany you to bed?”The familiar aura of the Iceberg Queen was back.Looking at Xia Xueqi’s smile and playful eyes.The cold sweat on Su Mingyuan’s forehead suddenly poured out like a tide.***
