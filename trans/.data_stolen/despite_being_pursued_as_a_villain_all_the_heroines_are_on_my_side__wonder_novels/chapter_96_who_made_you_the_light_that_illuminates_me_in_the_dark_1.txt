Who was it written for?First rule out a wrong answer.It’s definitely not me!In other words, it’s definitely not me, Su Mingyuan.As for the rest of the candidates…Xiao Ran?If it had been developed according to the goals of the previous week, Xiao Ran should have attracted Murong Hongxue’s appreciation at this time, but it wasn’t enough for Murong Hongxue to fall in love with him so secretly.This week’s episode is even more impossible, one must know that Murong Hongxue has just ruined Xiao Ran’s plan.It can’t be something that I like you so I’m going to bully you, right?There is one more, that is naturally me, white knight.After all, besides me and Xiao Ran, Murong Hongxue has not been in contact with anyone else recently.But…is it possible?I’ve only met her once as a white knight. Even if I flirted with her at the time, it’s impossible to make her secretly agree with her just because of that meeting, right?It can’t be so outrageous.so. Besides…who else?Or was it really because of the inertia of the plot and the will of the world that she still fell in love with Xiao Ran, and then it was really a drama that I liked you so I wanted to bully you?Su Mingyuan was a little confused.It didn’t matter if he was not sure, after all, he was a high-ranking person now, as long as his words were a little vague and ambiguous, letting Murong Hongxue figure it out on her own.Don’t guess a woman’s mind, you just can’t guess.Then a mysterious smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, staring at Murong Hongxue with a gleam of wisdom in his eyes, as if he had seen through her.“Why does Miss Murong ask? Didn’t you just meet the person you’re talking about? He…”Before he could finish speaking, Murong Hongxue suddenly stretched out her pale jade fingers to block his lips, interrupting what he was about to say.“He…”Murong Hongxue gently leaned over, winked at him, followed his words and said with a smile, “He is far away in the sky now, but right in front of you, Mr. Knight.”Looking at Murong Hongxue’s eyes full of tenderness and hinting at him with a slight wink, Su Mingyuan was instantly stunned.This… What does this mean?Far in the sky, close in front of you?Yes… are you talking about me?Did something go wrong?You, Murong Hongxue, don’t seem to be that good at strategy, right? I just met once with you, flirted with you, and you fell for me?#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comSeeing the affectionate and charming smile on the corner of Murong Hongxue’s mouth, Su Mingyuan still couldn’t believe it.Murong Hongxue, you are actually playing with me now, right?Are you kidding me with the charm of a mature big sister and want to see my laughable appearance, right?He pushed her fingers away and smiled bitterly, “Miss Murong, why are you joking with me like this?”“I’m not joking with you, Mr. Knight.”Murong Hongxue was not annoyed when her finger was pushed away from Su Mingyuan’s lips. She did not expect that Su Mingyuan would suddenly come to her with a surprise at this moment, and she would never let go of this heaven-sent opportunity.Even if she was a little bolder, even if it seemed illogical, she still had to seize this opportunity and take the initiative to attack!My white knight, although I am not worthy of you, at least, can you let me occupy a little place in your heart?Just… a little is fine.In front of Su Mingyuan, she put the finger that had just touched his lips on her lips, and then lightly… licked it.Then she threw a charming look full of infinite charm at him.What the hell!The picture of this beautiful woman pointing her finger instantly stimulated Su Mingyuan’s little heart, and a slight redness crept up quietly at the base of his ear.He was completely shocked.Murong Hongxue, there is no need to play so big!You are already kissing me indirectly!However, at this moment, he suddenly realised a problem.A person like Murong Hongxue, who was extremely inferior and distorted because of her identity and childhood experience, would just put chastity more important than anyone else.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comIf it wasn’t because she really liked it, she couldn’t have made such a move.But…Will someone really fall in love with a person at first sight just because they met once, because of a small provocation?“Mr. Knight, do you believe… love at first sight?”It was at this moment that Murong Hongxue spoke up.“People like me who grew out of the rotten silt, what I want most are those pure white light, and I long for a beam of light that is willing to illuminate me after knowing all the darkness in my heart.”Speaking of this, her eyes were full of infinite emotion and tenderness, and she unconsciously recalled those times in her previous life.She recalled the time Su Mingyuan spent with her when she was dressed as a white knight.Recalling that night, Su Mingyuan smiled and fondly touched her head and said to her, “You are not dirty.”
