His prior arrangements really played a role at this time.Xia Xueqi did not resist at all at this time.This iceberg beauty, who had always been cold and arrogant, showed a charming attitude that had never been shown in front of outsiders at that time, and such a beautiful scenery could only be appreciated by Su Mingyuan.The light on the screen reflected her delicate face slightly, her eyes were a little blurry, and from time to time, she made a softer voice than the heroine in the movie.Her thighs felt delicate and elastic, firm and silky, invoking countless fantasies.And her pair of plump and soft assets were pressed in a seductive shape, creating a narrow valley, and there was almost no obstruction in Su Mingyuan’s vision.As long as he lowered his head, he could see the most evil and alluring bottomless abyss…Xia Xueqi’s coquettish and seductive gesture made Su Mingyuan’s eyes straight, and his expression became crazy. His other hand couldn’t help but want to climb the peak…Just when he couldn’t help it, she suddenly came close to his ear, licked his earlobe lightly, and said with an extremely charming tone, “Mingyuan, only now, if you want to touch…”“…… it’s okay.”Boom!At this moment, Su Mingyuan felt that a certain string in his mind was about to be broken by Xia Xueqi’s deep provocation.But, he finally held back and didn’t make a move.Although Xia Xueqi had sent him an invitation, what if he crossed the limits set by the system this time and his Villain Points were deducted?He hadn’t even finished his exploration of actions, and he was not sure where the boundaries lied. Just taking the initiative with words, he was afraid it wouldn’t work.Unless……Xia Xueqi took the initiative to hold his hand and put it on top of her assets.Moreover, with the arrangement and design this time, it was originally intended to make Xia Xueqi unable to help but take the initiative and be attracted to him.He was trying to make Xia Xueqi fall in love with him with all his heart, not that he was seduced by the other party instead.If he didn’t hold back and took the first step here, wouldn’t it prove that he was completely attracted by Xia Xueqi’s charm, and he was the one who in turn was seduced by the other party’s temptation?At that time, whoever took the initiative would  be the one who was emotionally passive!And because there was that rule that kept him alert all the time, Su Mingyuan had the incomparable confidence to guarantee that he would never lose this game, at least it would be a draw.“What’s the matter, Mingyuan. I have already allowed it, why are you pretending to be a gentleman at this time?”Xia Xueqi looked at Su Mingyuan who wanted to move but didn’t dare to move, covered her mouth and laughed softly.“Could it be…, you want to use this method to further improve the evaluation in my heart?”“Actually, it’s already very high, otherwise I wouldn’t allow you to do such a thing.”Her jade fingers drew circles on Su Mingyuan’s chest, and every frown and smile was full of enchanting enchanting.“Or… do you like being passive? You want me to take the initiative to serve you? Yes, as long as you say something to me.”Xia Xueqi licked her lips lightly and stared at him with infinite amorous feelings flowing between her eyebrows.“I love you.”She knew that under the influence of the will of the world, Mingyuan must have suffered very hard.But, it doesn’t matter, as long as you are willing, as long as you say you love me, I am willing to take the initiative to do anything for you.Although she was hoping that Su Mingyuan would take the initiative to confess to her.But, in fact, at the moment when these words were spoken, she had already expressed her intentions to him one step ahead.However, her words matched with such a charming and seductive expression, but Su Mingyuan tried to make a naked provocation.At that moment, the instincts and desires of the two had been aroused, and whoever couldn’t bear it first was the one who lost.Are you Xia Xueqi teasing me like this?Of course I won’t shoot you directly, but isn’t it just flirting?Do you think I can’t?Su Mingyuan immediately did not want to be outdone, his fingers wandered recklessly on Xia Xueqi’s skin, pinching, kneading, tapping, pressing, stimulating her desire to the greatest extent. The iceberg melted into gentle streams, and her eyes were already glowing faintly.#pleasreadthischapteratwondernovels.comIn the end, there was no winner in this war.Su Mingyuan didn’t get Xia Xueqi’s plea for mercy, and she didn’t get his affectionate confession.When they came out of the cinema, they both walked to the pool in unison, and used the cold water to extinguish the flames in their hearts.The water drops drenched a few strands of Xia Xueqi’s drooping blue silk. She flipped her hair and looked at Su Mingyuan, who was also using cold water to calm his mood, and suddenly laughed softly, “Mingyuan, you held back and didn’t shoot at me just now, which really surprised me.”“I also thought that after an iceberg like you melted, the outburst of emotions and desires would make you unable to control the stirring emotions. I didn’t expect your will to be so firm.” Su Mingyuan patted his face with cold water.“Mingyuan, do you know that your evaluation in my heart now is a complete step up?” Xia Xueqi gestured upward. The smile on her face became more and more beautiful and moving.Su Mingyuan turned his head and smiled at her, “Same here.”
