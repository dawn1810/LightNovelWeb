When Xia Xueqi and Su Mingyuan walked towards the restaurant together holding hands, Xiao Ran’s fists were clenched hard. In addition to him.There was also Su Xuelan, who was even further behind, fuming with rage.The Human imagination has always been rich.Seeing Xia Xueqi holding her brother Mingyuan’s hand, she imagined that the two would most likely hug each other in the restaurant later.Next may be a kiss.What would they do next…Su Xuelan really didn’t dare to think about it!Damn Xia Xueqi, she can do whatever she wants with her fiancee status, right?At that time, Su Xuelan wanted to open the car door and rush in angrily to separate the two.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBut when she was just about to take a step forward, the problem that had been lingering in her heart once again appeared in her mind.You, Su Xuelan, as Su Mingyuan’s sister, what qualifications do you have to stop him from dating his fiancee?Yes!Even if she ran up a few steps to separate the hands that were holding each other, and would not allow them to date, would she win because of this?At that time, Mingyuan would look at her suspiciously and ask her: Sister, why don’t you let me date my fiance?How should she answer?How should she face his eyes like that?She……She was not qualified!Should I say in front of Xia Xueqi that she is not a good woman, and tell Mingyuan to stay away from her and be careful?Or should I say that the reason why I stopped the two from dating is actually for Mingyuan’s good?Then Xia Xueqi would definitely pretend to be weak and hurt at the sidelines, in stark contrast to her vicious image of speaking ill of people.On the contrary, it was easy for Mingyuan, who saw this scene, to secretly blame and dissatisfied with her in the bottom of his heart, and the relationship between the siblings which had finally been brought closer would be pushed away by her own hands…As an older sister, she had no reason to be here to stop their date!Damn!Damn it, damn it!Damn this identity!If only I had swapped identities with Xia Xueqi…Su Xuelan gritted her teeth fiercely, and a tide of regrets washed over her.Because she suddenly discovered that she could only sit in the car and watch the intimate interaction between Xia Xueqi and Mingyuan.Just like Xiao Ran who chose to escape when he found out that the two were dating, he couldn’t do anything except watch here!But she didn’t choose to escape or run away, instead she still stayed here.Anyway, she knew, whether she stayed here or not, whether she saw the date between the two.As her good sister Xia Xueqi, she would definitely send a series of photos to piss her off after the date ended.That being the case…I’m going to stay here and see if you really do those intimate things to Mingyuan!And at this moment, she noticed Nick sneaking out of Xiao Ran’s car.Seeing him cautiously hiding behind a willow tree, he carefully observed and monitored the movement in the restaurant.Xiao Ran’s subordinate?So to say……The person in the car just now… was Xiao Ran?For some reason, when she thought that Xiao Ran must have seen the scene where the two of them held hands just now, and how he would be so angry in the car, Su Xuelan’s mood suddenly improved a lot.But you still dare to keep people down to watch them…There was a flash of cold killing intent in her eyes.Then this person let him stay here forever.Otherwise, when he saw that Xia Xueqi and Mingyuan had done intimate things, he would report the matter to Xiao Ran, so that Xia Xueqi’s disguise in front of Xiao Ran would be fully exposed…Su Xuelan’s slender fingertips revealed a wisp of invisible and sharp qi.It was just the right time to extinguish this person to vent out emotions.Not only could she just watch and do nothing, but she had to help Xia Xueqi and Mingyuan get rid of the little mouse that was watching over them in order to take care of the overall situation.Thinking of this, Su Xuelan felt even more uncomfortable.………………Xia Xueqi’s reserved location this time was the same as last time, and it was also by the window.Below the boundless blue sky, accompanied by a serene lake, and the melodious willows singing along with the rhythm of gentle wind, they chatted while appreciating the view, which was obviously very emotional.Su Mingyuan took her hand, barged into the door of the restaurant, and walked up to the reserved seat.During the whole process, Su Mingyuan’s hand did not get a single second of peace.Sometimes she made a circle on her palm, and sometimes she rubbed her fingertips on the back of his hand.Xia Xueqi was very pleased, but when she walked to the seat, there was a slight disgust on her face as she said in a cold tone,“Have you touched enough?”“Of course not.”Seeing her like this, Su Mingyuan immediately became excited.It was not because he was a pervert with a strange fetish, but Xia Xueqi’s eyes were full of disgust, but she had to play along with him, and hold his hand. It was so exciting, so cool!The more you are upset with me, the more you can only play with me helplessly, haha.Even when he reached the seat, he did not intend to let go, but instead said, “Xueqi, do you remember what you asked me to do on the last date? You didn’t allow me to sit across you at that time, thinking that a couple like us, even if they were pretending, should sit on the same side and be next to each other. “#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com“So your smooth and tender little hand, I can hold and play until the date is over, hahahaha!”Su Mingyuan suddenly rushed to the innermost part of the table, and then with a slight push, he pulled Xia Xueqi, who was still standing, to a stagger and pulled her into his arms.Xia Xueqi opened her mouth slightly and exclaimed, her whole body fell into his embrace, panic never leaving her for a slight second. Her slender and fragrant body was so close to him, especially the face that was always cold, arrogant and even disgusted. This invoked a blush out of cold beauty.Su Mingyuan wanted to laugh comfortably in his heart.Bad woman, today I have to let you know the consequences of disrespecting people!At the same time, he still shouted to the system in his heart:System, you have to keep your eyes open and see clearly, I didn’t take advantage of her and violated her.I just held her hand the whole time, and she took the initiative to stretch out her hand into mine.This time, she didn’t stand up and took the initiative to fall into my arms. It has nothing to do with me. I was passive throughout the whole process. You must not deduct my villain points because of this trivial matter!The system remained silent, not knowing whether it was because it was really persuaded by his crooked reasoning, or was shocked to the point of speechlessness by his shamelessness.In short, the system did not deduct his villain points.While enjoying the taste of a warm body in his arms, Su Mingyuan pretended to be concerned, “Xueqi, are you alright? What floor tiles are laid in this restaurant that almost tripped my Xueqi! Last time, too, a passing waiter almost tripped over and bumped into you, Xueqi, letting you miss your first kiss. Oh, I really should give this restaurant a bad review!”#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBad review? How is this possible!I’ll give it a five-star review when I go back!Su Mingyuan said that he was concerned, but there was not a trace of remorse or anger in voice, and he was deliberately trying to embarrass Xia Xueqi.Xia Xueqi freed herself from his embrace, sat next to him, and gave him a hateful stare, but because of the faint red glow on her face at this time, she looked rather coquettish.Soon, her expression returned to calm, and the red glow on her face also faded. Even though her slender hand was being played by Su Mingyuan in the palm of his hand, one could not see the slightest ripple in her expression or eyes.“Mingyuan, order,” she brought the menu and said in a flat tone.Su Mingyuan immediately felt provoked when he saw her so calm that she didn’t even take him seriously.***
