The outer battlefield had nothing to do with Gu Qing’an now.She was practising happily.In the quiet room, Gu Qing’an sat cross-legged, her eyebrows lowered, and a slight tremor came from her nose.She used breathing to drive qi and blood, and nourish her body, resolving the deep damage caused by practising external exercises during the day.Qi and blood were transported and circulated endlessly.“Huh…” Suddenly, Gu Qing’an let out a long breath and opened her eyes.A gleam of light flashed in her eyes.“The forging has reached the fourth level.”[Repair: Forging Body Quadruple (1%)]She stood up and arrived in front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror.The girl in the mirror was beautiful and her features were picturesque.Her figure was more slender than the previous day, and her waist was full, as if she was a weak and unpretentious family daughter.The training of the body-building exercises made her look thinner than before, only the light in her eyes was as bright as stars.But, this kind of thinness was obviously just an facade. Gu Qing’an felt the terrifying force surging in her limbs, and squeezed her fist slightly as a series of crisp sounds echoed from her hands.She smiled. “I am getting stronger and stronger.”Five days had passed by now, and Gu Qing’an had already practised Basic Body Forging 4.With the Jingyu rank , coupled with the daily medicinal bath, Gu Qing’an’s cultivation speed was ridiculously fast.During the body forging period, the main body was the physical body, and the influence of talent was too great.This stage was mainly to accumulate Qi and blood.If it was said that a person with low aptitude cultivated qi and blood like injecting water drop by drop into a bucket, waiting for the water to gradually fill up.Then, Gu Qing’an’s practice already had a bucket full of water, and she used the high-pressure water gun and continued to progress.In fact, this outrageous speed was deliberately slowed down by Gu Qing’an in order to lay a solid foundation.Gu Qing’an thought with peace of mind.‘Today’s practice is almost done, haste is not good.’“Let’s go find Xiao Mengran and Wan Bai for ice cream.”Now Pingzhou was about to enter the winter, and there were Daoist inscriptions in the resident room of Jing Yao, which kept it as warm as spring.‘It’s cool to turn on the heating and eat ice in winter.’Pingzhou had flat terrain, facing the sea in the east and Jingzhou in the west.Jinzhou had many mountains, and many rivers flow from Jin to Ping and merge into the sea.The two states of Ping and Jin were bounded by the Qingyi Mountains.The mountains here were towering, surrounded by clouds and mist all year round, and were extremely dangerous. It was said that when Yun Dynasty merged Jinzhou into the Tianyun Realm, it killed an demon god here.Therefore, monsters breed from time to time in the Qingyi Mountains, harassing the surrounding villages and towns, and the surrounding people felt bitter.But, at the same time, there were countless treasures in this mountain, and every few decades, people rely on the treasures brought out of the Qingyi Mountains to become rich overnight, attracting countless desperados and gold diggers to come here.At that time, deep in the Qingyi Mountains.The surrounding was a thick darkness that could hardly be dissolved. Under the shadow of countless towering giant trees and the influence of a strange force, there was almost no daylight in this place.In this darkness, several voices were communicating.“It’s interesting, Pingzhou has a new Jingyu rank.” A cold male voice sounded.What he said was not the Dacheng language of today, but the language of the An Dynasty period, with a strange regional accent that sounded obscure.“Jie Jie, she’s still a girl, but she’s really eye-catching. I really want to make her the ancestor’s corpse girl.” An evil smile came out from the darkness.“Xie Ying, the plan is coming at a critical juncture, don’t make extra troubles.”Another voice sounded. This voice was very calm, and the tone did not fluctuate at all.The owner of this calm voice seemed to have a lot of status. As soon as he opened his mouth, the first two stopped talking.“Ku Chan, don’t be so serious. In my opinion, let the remnants of Youquan Sect move about this matter.” A charming female voice sounded.“Youquan Sect… It’s okay, then let them move. With our resources, we must do something, and we can’t keep them in vain.” The calm voice sounded again.After the words were finished, everything was finalised.There was silence again in the darkness.In the afternoon, Black River City.The crowd was surging, and it was noisy.Most of the people on the street wore padded jackets, but there were still many strong men sweating profusely, wearing bunts, coming and going in a hurry.They were unloaders on the docks or sailors.Black River City was built on the Black River River, relying on water to draft.There were many merchant ships, and they also supported many Heihe people.Now that winter was approaching, and the Black River was about to freeze. They were seizing the opportunity to take the last job, and strive to add a cotton coat to their shivering child this winter.In addition, many members of the Chijiao Sect  could be seen on the dock watching over ships and recruiting labourers.The Chijiao Sect  was a subordinate force of the Gu family.Both Gu and Wei had established their own subordinate forces to govern these people who live on the Black River and make profits from it.Some time ago, the Gu family was in decline.The reason why the Wei family jumped so fast was also due to economic interests. The competition with the ecological niche was the fiercest.The profits of the wharf were huge. Even in the past when the two families were in harmony, the two subordinate forces, the Xiefu Sect and the Chijiao Sect, often fought each other, resulting in many casualties.The dead were thrown directly into the Black River and fed with fish and shrimp.Beneath the rolling black river, the bones were piled high.But, because Gu Qing’an appeared in the Gu family, the Wei family admitted in public, and the main family turned soft.Therefore, the current pier was almost dominated by the Gu family’s Chijiao Sect.It was lunchtime at that time, and the poor could only afford two meals a day, lunch and dinner.A Chijiao Sect raised his voice for the crowd.“Dinner’s ready.”“All line up, don’t cut in line!”“Damn, it’s you who said it.” The gang beat them down with a whip.The man who was beaten smirked and took a few steps back.This group of people said loudly, “Come here, listen carefully. As to congratulate Miss Gu, everyone will add an extra piece of fish today.”The workers below all had happy expressions on their faces.“Thank you, Miss Gu.”“Thank you, Miss Gu.”They might not be able to understand the concept of Gu Qing’an’s Jingyu rank, but they could take advantage of it anyway.The Gu family didn’t mind these things, just gave a little favour and bought people’s hearts.In the past two years, the trade route had declined somewhat, and these labourers have had a hard time.“Gu family…” Jiang Yanlan glanced at the noisy pier, covered her face with a hood, and left quietly.She walked around the city, seemingly unintentionally doing some graffiti in several alleys.Then out of town.After half an hour, a simple middle-aged man walked into an alley.When the filthy homeless children saw him, their eyes gleamed.The simple middle-aged man took out a few warm noodles from his arms.He said gently, “Eat, eat.”With a glance, he saw the graffiti Jiang Yanlan had left behind.He calmly wrote down the graffiti symbols out of the corner of his eyes, then turned and left.—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
