As expected of an iceberg beauty. She is indifferent even after facing my teasing.Humph, when you beg me to take an intimate photo later, I will let you know.“By the way, Xueqi, you must be feeling uncomfortable being forced to date with a dude like me by your family? I wonder what your partner Xiao Ran will think of you when he finds out about it…”Su Mingyuan’s voice was low and deep, like a blunt knife cutting through flesh, and in a playful and slow tone, he revealed cruel facts in front of Xia Xueqi.Killing move.I, Su Mingyuan, must see Xia Xueqi angry today!Moreover, this was also in line with his playful image, in line with the script that he, as a villain, was extremely disgusted by the female protagonist Xia Xueqi.In fact, sometimes, indulging one’s inner emotions like this seemed to be quite… not bad?Anyway, it just happens to be roughly in line with his villain character.“Mingyuan, dating you is indeed because of the persecution of the family, which is something I do not want.”However, even after hearing such a heart-wrenching remark, Xia Xueqi’s expression still did not change. Instead, she turned her head to look at him, and said calmly and indifferently, “Also, I want to clarify one thing.”“Xiao Ran, he’s just my partner, one of my targets. If you think that there is an ambiguous relationship between me and him, and you want to use this to stimulate me and anger me, then you can forget it. I feel sorry for you.”“As for how he likes me? Heh,” Xia Xueqi raised her chin arrogantly, a trace of contempt flashed in her eyes. “What does this have to do with me?”What!Su Mingyuan was surprised.Xia Xueqi didn’t fall in love with Xiao Ran according to the development of the plot?He thought that after he asked Ruoruo to call Xiao Ran last time to re-enforce thecooperation between Xia Xueqi and Xiao Ran, the development between the two should be the same as the development in the novel.After all, Xia Xueqi was the female protagonist with the least personality change in his eyes, and she did take Xiao Ran to a dinner party.There should have been a love affair between them.Who knew……She hadn’t liked Xiao Ran until now, but just treated him as a partner, an object that could be used?Seeing Su Mingyuan’s surprised appearance, Xia Xueqi smiled in her heart.This was a rhetoric she had long prepared to come up with at the right time, and it came in handy on this occasion.Xiao Ran?What was he?She couldn’t let Mingyuan always feel that she had fallen in love with Xiao Ran in his heart, and treat her subconsciously as Xiao Ran’s woman.If Mingyuan had been getting along with her with such a mentality, how could she slowly rub off sparks with him and make him fall in love with her?“You really…don’t like Xiao Ran?” Su Mingyuan looked at her nervously.“Like? You think I’m going to like a fool who ruins my reputation by spreading rumours in front of so many people?”Xia Xueqi sneered disdainfully and glanced at him.“Mingyuan, although I don’t like you now, I also feel disgusted with him.”Ah this…Su Mingyuan was a little dazed, and quickly asked, “Then will you still cooperate with him?”“Of course, he is so useful to me, why won’t I cooperate with him?”Xia Xueqi sneered, looking at Su Mingyuan with extremely cold eyes, but they seemed to hold a trace of inexplicable expectations. “Of course, if one day Mingyuan you can make me fall in love with you and make me willingly accept this engagement, I’d be too lazy to care about that idiot.”Forget it.Although you don’t like Xiao Ran, if maintaining the status quo allows you to continue to maintain your partnership with him and ensure that the plot will not go wrong, why should I try to make you like me?No, wait a minute, if Xia Xueqi, a bad woman, fell in love with me with all her heart, wouldn’t it be a simple and casual thing for me to ask her to play with me at that time?After the development of the story, she could obediently listen to me, and follow my instructions to make everything develop according to the plot of the novel.And my plot performance, won’t I have to worry about nothing going wrong because of her broken character?Right now, I have to make a deal with her to ensure that in the next performance, she will not appear on the scene to interfere with the effect of my performance and my final evaluation.As long as she is dead in love with me.Moreover, if I can hold this bad woman who is always cold and arrogant and likes to look at me with disgusting eyes.Under his stare, her face was full of redness. She whispered something, “I didn’t do this because I like you, huh! I don’t feel comfortable at all in this way”…Hiss–!It’s over, it’s over.I got excited.The emotions that were originally chaotic in the presence of Xia Xueqi suddenly became more out of control, and his reached to the end of the universe.This damn bad woman just said a word, and it made me mess up and lose my mind.Especially at this moment, seeing Su Mingyuan’s appearance, she actually let go of her cold and arrogant temperament, her pink and attractive tongue stuck out a little bit from her mouth, and she smiled at him very charmingly.In an instant, Su Mingyuan’s brain seemed to have short-circuited, his mouth turned dry, and his heart was beating wildly, about to fly out of his chest!Hello!It’s too much!Don’t play like this!You are an iceberg beauty, this is not the way you should behave.Xia Xueqi! You made me so flustered that my heart is beating wildly, what the hell are you trying to do!However, Xia Xueqi had not stopped attacking.She gracefully stretched out her slender, slender fingers, lightly tapped on Su Mingyuan’s chest, leaned into his ear and said with a light smile, “Su Mingyuan, your heart is beating so fast… You seem to be moved by my proposal just now?”#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comWhen her finger lightly touched Su Mingyuan’s chest, and her breath fell gently on his ear, his heart seemed to be beating violently with great excitement.His thoughts were more confused and his emotions were getting increasingly agitated.Su Mingyuan looked at Xia Xueqi’s beautiful face close at hand, at the charming smile on her cold and pretty face, and at those big and limpid eyes.There was an urge to take the initiative to kiss.No, not just kisses, but assault!He wanted to violate her severely!However, the moment he had this thought, the rule that if he actively violated the heroine, villain points would be deducted also appeared in his mind.He suddenly woke up.Looking back at Xia Xueqi’s smiling face, he woke up in a trance.Didn’t it look like she was toying with him.He grabbed Xia Xueqi’s hand tightly, stared into her eyes and asked, “Is it fun to tease me like this, Xia Xueqi?”“I’m not kidding you, Mingyuan, what I just said was the truth.”Xia Xueqi smiled again, but at this time, her face had regained her former calm and cold look. “Also, remember to call me Xueqi.” She even calmly did not forget to remind him at this moment.“However, I thought you couldn’t help kissing me just now, but I didn’t expect you to restrain yourself very well. Mingyuan, your evaluation in my heart has improved a little bit, that’s all.”#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com“Yes?”Su Mingyuan’s heart was slightly agitated. “But now whether you like me or not, you are my fiancee in name, you have to show a good relationship with me in front of the Xia family. You want to date me, and take pictures with me to prove our intimacy.”“So what?” Xia Xueqi raised her chin again and asked indifferently.“So……”As soon as Su Mingyuan gritted his teeth, he wanted to take revenge and let Xia Xueqi know who should beg for mercy.“Isn’t the purpose of your dating me just to leave photos to prove our close relationship?”He grabbed Xia Xueqi’s hand slightly and pulled her into his arms, “Let’s shoot now, I must let you know what real intimacy is today!”
