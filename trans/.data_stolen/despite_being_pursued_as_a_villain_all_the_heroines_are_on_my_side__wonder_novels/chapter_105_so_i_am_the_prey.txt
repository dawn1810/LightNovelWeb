Who is the hunter and who is the prey?After resting in Su Mingyuan’s arms for a while, Xia Xueqi opened her eyes, and the cold and arrogant feeling returned to her body.However, the faint blush that had not yet faded from the two eyes showed that she did not seem to have recovered from her drunkenness at this time.She forced her elbows to support the table and wanted to stand up, but her balance was unsteady, and she fell back into Su Mingyuan’s arms, rubbing lightly on him unconsciously.Hiss–!Su Mingyuan gritted his teeth and held back, not letting her feel anything strange.Because Xia Xueqi had her back to him, he couldn’t see the playful smile on the corner of Xia Xueqi’s mouth at this time.Especially when she heard his breathless voice, the smile silently expanded a little.It’s… interesting.The second time, Xia Xueqi finally managed to stand up, and this time she didn’t even need him to help.The warm fragrance suddenly left, making Su Mingyuan feel a little empty in his heart, and an inexplicable disappointment emerged spontaneously.Xia Xueqi rubbed her forehead, looked at him and asked, “As for this date, Mingyuan, what are your plans next?”“There is a movie theatre not far away. I wonder if I have the honour to invite you to a movie?” Su Mingyuan asked with a smile.“There are some old-fashioned dating places, Mingyuan,” Xia Xueqi said lightly, but she did not refuse.Su Mingyuan just smiled lightly without refuting.Although old-fashioned, old-fashioned also often meant that the vast majority of people do this.The movie theatre looked big, but it felt very small when you were in it. Except for the bright screen, the surrounding was full of darkness and the world.In this case, the couple would subconsciously snuggle together.Xia Xueqi drank alcohol herself and was a little drunk, and ambiguous and exciting pictures and sounds played on the screen, plus the sultry environment and air in the cinema.It was easy to make people’s heartbeat and body temperature rise faster, and unconsciously fall into the emotion of love.At this time, one can have some physical contact and more intimate interaction and touch. As long as one doesn’t do it too much, the woman will not only not resist too much, but will become more and more blushing, bow her head shyly, and let you take whatever you want.Of course, the premise of all this is that the woman already has a certain favourable impression on you.Su Mingyuan guessed that because of the reversal of his image and the alliance with each other, he should already have a good degree of favorability in Xia Xueqi’s heart.Otherwise, even in a drunken state, she would not allow herself to hug him like that and feed her water.Of course, this must also be inseparable from the first two unexpected top assists that made her less repulsive to her contacts.After all, they have done even more of that.And what was next, of course, was to seize the good opportunity of Xia Xueqi’s hazy drunken state, and further attack her, and blow her goodwill in one fell swoop!In this state of being sober but not sober, she would neither forget the ambiguous contact between the two of them during this period, so that she would recognize him after she wakes up, and won’t show too much resistance.After paying the bill and walking out of the restaurant, Su Mingyuan looked at the charming Xia Xueqi beside him, and couldn’t help but start to test.She still took a noble and elegant step, walking down the street.Every move was captivating.It was just that her footsteps were not as calm as usual and the speed at which she slowed down showed that she still had residual drunkenness.This was a red wine with great power specially chosen by Su Mingyuan. In the next few hours, Xia Xueqi would not even think about getting out of this state!Su Mingyuan started his little test.He walked first, from a distance of half a metre away from Xia Xueqi, and slowly approached her to a distance of a few tens of centimetres from her, to a distance of only a few centimetres. With just a little movement, he could touch her hand.Xia Xueqi didn’t seem to react.Everyone had his own alert field. When others were at a distance outside the field, they would feel safe and comfortable, and vice versa.Generally speaking, the closer the relationship between the other person and you, the higher the acceptance of him in your heart.The more one could tolerate the more intrusions into your territory without feeling embarrassed.Su Mingyuan was already very close at this time, but Xia Xueqi still did not show any uncomfortable expression. What does this mean?Although this was helped by being intoxicated, it could also be because they had had more intimate contact before, and Xia Xueqi was already resistant to it.But.The main reason was that Xia Xueqi had a favourable impression of him, not a dislike!And this good feeling should not be low!After testing out such information, Su Mingyuan was more sure of the next step he was going to take in the future.Next, he had to take the most important step here!Hold hands!Although this was just a simple and ordinary action, it played a vital role in the symbolic meaning of the relationship between men and women.Holding hands often meant a further step in the relationship between men and women, and a complete breakthrough. It was an existence with the same significance as a milestone.#pleasereadthiscjapteratwondernovels.comNo matter how close one is with a girl, how ambiguous, how much you talk about, but before holding hands, your relationship will always be – friends.Holding hands means the determination of the relationship and the breakthrough from friends to lovers.Although this is a simple action, it means that from now on, she is willing to entrust her life to your hands, and you are also willing to put your happiness in her hands.This is an invisible and wordless agreement, a promise from two people to one.Only after holding hands, can everything that follows follow a natural progression.Hugs, kisses, bed rolls…Su Mingyuan’s hand was less than two centimetres away from Xia Xueqi’s slender hand at this time, and the two were very close.In the process of walking, he pretended not to know anything, and from time to time, intentionally or unintentionally, he gently brushed the back of her smooth white hand with his hand.Xia Xueqi’s light-white jade hand dodged and trembled slightly like a frightened bunny at first, and then when he touched the back of her hand again, the range of dodge was much smaller.The fingers of the two would occasionally collide and intertwine, and then they would be separated at the touch of a button. Xia Xueqi’s resistance became smaller and smaller, but the faint blush on her cheeks seemed to be more and more beautiful, and even her ears were slightly red.Seeing this, Su Mingyuan smiled with satisfaction.Xia Xueqi, you look so drunk and slightly shy, so cute.He knew that at this moment, the time had come!Time to take the most important step!The next time the two people’s fingers rubbed the backs of their hands lightly, he no longer hesitated and grabbed Xia Xueqi’s little hand with a little overbearing gesture.Xia Xueqi stopped shyly and exclaimed in a low voice in surprise. She forcibly separated her slender fingers, as if declaring sovereignty, and inserted her fingers one by one into his.Xia Xueqi struggled a little symbolically, but Su Mingyuan held her little hand extremely strongly at this time, preventing her from leaving.At this time.Just be tough!Just to be domineering!Just to conquer!He just gave her a hint: You, Xia Xueqi, are my Su Mingyuan’s little woman!Xia Xueqi did not continue to break free, as if tacitly agreeing that the relationship between the two would go further.She raised her face slightly, those cold eyes that were more moving because they were covered with a touch of drunkenness, but at this moment, there was a hint of clarity in them.“Mingyuan, didn’t you deliberately get me drunk so that you could take the opportunity to hold my hand at this time?”She seemed to see through his plan at a glance.Su Mingyuan’s heart jumped, but he said with a smile without showing any flaws on his face, “How could it be? Xueqi, I drank more than you. I didn’t expect this wine to have such a strong effect, and you may be a little bit incapable of drinking, so you are still a little drunk. Not to mention I If I really want to get you drunk, I don’t need to ask someone to prepare sober soup for you, right?”Xia Xueqi stared at him for a while, until Su Mingyuan was so nervous that his heart began to beat wildly.Just when he was nervous and tried hard not to let his guilty conscience be seen by her, she suddenly smiled, as if the snow lotus on the iceberg was quietly blooming at this moment.“Mingyuan, although your disguise is very good this time, and you have improved a lot compared to the last time, your words still reveal your guilty conscience? You should pay attention to this next time.”She stretched out her index finger and lightly tapped his lips, “However, I don’t reject holding hands with you either…”“And also……”She smiled lightly, and the finger that had just touched Su Mingyuan’s lips gently landed on her rose petal-like lips again.In an instant, Su Mingyuan recalled the matter of drinking sober soup at the place with the lipstick mark and kissing Xia Xueqi indirectly.“Did the hangover soup that was stained with my lipstick tasted better, Mingyuan?”Xia Xueqi licked the corners of her lips in a very seductive manner. There was a hint of playfulness and a hint of shyness into her limpid eyes, and her raised face was even more indescribably charming.How charming, I can’t help but be tempted.This woman not only guessed everything, but saw it!And back to tease me!I’m really fucking tempted!This nasty bad woman!Damn bad woman!This abominable and damned bad woman is so sweet and charming!At this moment, Su Mingyuan suddenly realised that he seemed to be the little white rabbit who walked into the hunter’s trap.Before Xia Xueqi fell in love with him, he was probably the one who fell first…
