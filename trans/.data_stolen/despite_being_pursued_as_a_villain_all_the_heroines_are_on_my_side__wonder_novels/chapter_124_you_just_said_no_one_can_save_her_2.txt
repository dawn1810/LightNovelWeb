Xia Rongze laughed wildly, and his expression became more and more hideous. He seemed to be unable to wait to use the power of the family.Liu Xi wanted to say something, but was stopped by Liu Mengning’s eyes.“Little girl, no one can save you now. Hahahaha! See the reality! Now even if I don’t rely on the power of the family, I can still bully you and ravage you! But you can’t do anything!”Seeing this scene, the eyes of the old man of the Liu family suddenly widened in anger, and he was so angry that he was about to rush out immediately.How could he not recognize his granddaughter even with sunglasses on?“A junior from the Xia family dares to be so arrogant, and dare to bully my Mengning like this in broad daylight?”“Lao Liu, don’t worry.” The old man of the Ye family hurriedly grabbed him and pointed in the other direction, “Look, isn’t the saviour coming?”The old man of the Liu family turned his head to look, and just saw the mysterious white masked boy who played chess with Lao Liu last time, walking over from the other end of the path.Under such circumstances, would he dare to stand up for a stranger he never knew?Especially since the other party was the young master of the Xia family.Su Mingyuan was just wandering around when he happened to come to this park.Thinking that the last time he bullied the old man of the Ye family so badly, he couldn’t help but have a thought: Why don’t I… do it again?The impulse that I had just held back in Hongxue couldn’t be vented, so it can be vented on the chessboard!As a result, he had just walked into the park, when he faintly heard a shouts from the front.After taking another two steps, he saw Xia Rongze rolling up his sleeves and walking towards Liu Mengning, looking like he was about to hit a woman.“No one can save you!” “You are helpless!”………Su Mingyuan’s eyes suddenly lit up, feeling that a great opportunity appeared in front of him.He was worried about how to get closer to Liu Mengning as a white knight, so that he could use this relationship as a starting point, and find a way to make her choose Xiao Ran as an investor in her new movie.In the end, didn’t this opportunity just come?But, um… why do I always feel that the scene in front of me is a little familiar?Hiss–Calculating the time and location, isn’t this the scene where Xiao Ran and Liu Mengning met for the first time last week?Su Mingyuan suddenly remembered.In the last week, Liu Mengning was harassed by gangsters here, and then Xiao Ran appeared in a heroic manner and successfully helped her out of the siege.Although he didn’t know why, the hooligans who were supposed to play here turned into Xia Rongze, who had the same attributes as them, but the effect was not bad.So…my silly son, Xiao Ran, will appear soon?And if I came out and rescued Liu Mengning at this time, it would be equivalent to… cutting off their relationship that might be linked in the future?Hiss–!Isn’t that right!Son, last week I was outside the plot that belonged to me. In order to get the plot back on track, I worked so hard to rescue and help other heroines so many times, but the favorability I gained became yours under the influence of the will of Heaven.I’ll cut you off once this week, isn’t it okay?Besides, now my identity as a white knight is your junior brother. I will increase the favorability of the heroine towards me, and our relationship will improve and deepen. If you need help after that, I will let her help you from time to time, wouldn’t it have the same effect?It just so happens that you can spend less effort, and save more time on the heroine.Your extra energy, time and efforts can just be spent thinking about how to deal with me and your enemy Xiao family, right?Look, Xiao Ran, Dad thinks about you a lot!Therefore, this opportunity would be taken from you without hesitation!Su Mingyuan immediately walked towards Xia Rongze.When Xia Rongze walked in front of Liu Mengning and raised his palms domineeringly, wanting to slap her glasses and swell her pretty face.His arm was tightly bound in midair by a slender, strong and powerful hand.“Hey, you just said no one could save her, did you?”Xia Rongze turned his head angrily, just as he was about to scold which dumb beast dared to disturb this young master’s good deeds, he happened to meet Su Mingyuan’s cold and ruthless eyes.At that moment, it was as if a basin of cold water was poured from the top of the head, dousing all his rising anger.Xia Rongze’s legs trembled suddenly, and he only felt a chill rise from his tailbone.“Unfortunately, I’m here.”Su Mingyuan’s voice was incomparably cold, and a chilling cruel smile evoked on the corner of his lips.Facing scum, he had to teach him a painful lesson today.Xia Rongze was so frightened that his face turned pale, and he was speechless for a while.But, when his pounding heartbeat slowly calmed down, he recognized that this man in a white trench coat and a mask was the subordinate of Murong Hongxue.A surge of anger suddenly burned even more fiercely in his heart.Who do you think you are?A dog under Murong Hongxue dares to threaten me, Xia Rongze?
