If Mingyuan learned about what I did for him, he would definitely be moved to tears in his heart, right?The corners of Murong Hongxue’s mouth rose slightly, revealing a smile of anticipation and joy like a teenage woman in love.It was completely different from the contemptuous and cold look she had facing Xiao Ran.However, she did not intend to take credit and tell Su Mingyuan about this.She knew the silent sacrifice behind these things, she didn’t expect to move him, move her white knight, the light of her life.She was already dirty. If she used this method to win Mingyuan’s sincerity, it would only make her feel more dirty.But since I’ve done so much for Mingyuan, since I’m no longer clean, then…Then, as an unclean woman, if I have sex with Mingyuan on a date, that’s okay too, right?Thinking of this, Murong Hongxue happily took out her phone, opened the mysterious software, and logged in to the account she asked for from her subordinates.She was nervous and nervous, like a little girl in first love. She deleted and rewritten, rewritten and deleted, edited it several times, and finally, after struggling for a long time, she edited a message with the simplest content, and then tapped lightly. Thumbs down, sent over.[Brother Su, are you free today? I want to watch whales in the aquarium with you~~[Black silk legs photo.jpg][Black silk legs photo.jpg][Black silk legs photo.jpg]As soon as she finished sending the message, she held up the phone in anticipation and nervousness, and stared at the screen without blinking, for fear of missing Su Mingyuan reply.After a while, with a ding dong, Su Mingyuan’s reply came.Murong Hongxue’s heartbeat also jumped abruptly with this ding-dong and almost rose to heaven.Then it instantly fell to the ground and her heart broke into pieces.Su Mingyuan: [Sorry, I have an appointment with my fiancee today, next time.]And, I, married, wife, have, not, next, next, time.fiancée?!Next time?!Murong Hongxue’s eyes widened, only to feel that these words seemed to have turned into a sharp arrow piercing her heart at this moment.She just wanted to use a humble identity to make Mingyuan happy without any burden, so she finally get a little redemption and joy from this happiness.But Xia Xueqi!Do you want to steal even my tiny hopes and non extravagant demands!At this moment, a cold wind suddenly blew in the room, making the tables and chairs creak, generating a terrifying sound.Murong Hongxue’s eyes were crimson red, her hair was messy, and the ghostly, mysterious true qi in her body was running wildly in a turbulent flow.She had a vicious heart and ruthless methods.She treated anyone with a contemptuous and indifferent face, and she would not show any sympathy and pity because of someone’s miserable appearance.Except for one person!As long as it involved him, her mentality was easily out of balance. Her inferiority complex and her paranoia would make it difficult for her to control her emotions and make it impossible for her to maintain her own rationality!At this moment, boundless anger and killing intent filled Murong Hongxue’s mind, almost completely drowning her reason.She had no pen and paper at hand, so she could only keep writing the word “quiet” in her heart in an attempt to calm herself down.But no matter how she wrote it, no matter how many times she wrote it.She couldn’t hold back her emotions that were about to get out of control.The strokes begin to deform gradually, and the glyph structure begins to become distorted.In the end, the word “quiet” that she wrote thousands of times in her heart was actually deformed and twisted into a word “kill”.kill!Kill! Kill! Kill!Murong Hongxue suddenly opened her eyes.“Come here!”“Subordinates are here.”“Two nights later, Xiao Ran’s second group of men will take a plane and land at Ming City Airport outside the city. You bring someone to take them on their way to Ming City…”Murong Hongxue’s mouth slowly revealed extremely cruel and cold words, “…Kill them all.”“Yes!”After the subordinates retreated, Murong Hongxue covered her head, gritted her teeth, and slowly suppressed the uncontrollable emotions in her heart.No matter how angry she was just now, no matter how full of killing intent.She still knew what the big picture was, and knew that this was not the time when the sisters turned their backs on Xia Xueqi and started to lose their temper.For Mingyuan, she could endure.But the anger and killing intent in her heart still needed a place to vent.So……It could only be Xiao Ran.Just as she remembered her previous life, when Mingyuan and Xiao Ran clashed in Hongyun Building according to the plot of the novel, Xiao Ran’s second group of men also flew in from overseas and landed at Mingjing Airport.Oh, that group of mercenaries who killed countless people on the battlefield, would be killed now.Just to vent her anger.………………Su Mingyuan was sitting in the car on his way to the lakeside restaurant when he received a private message from the young lady on the mysterious software.Seeing the other party’s suggestive statement and the beautiful black legs that he wanted to play with, he could only say regretfully that he would definitely meet her next time.After all, today’s date with Xia Xueqi was more important.Moreover, it was to ensure that there would be no risk variables in the next performance. In order to get higher evaluation and villain points, he agreed to the invitation on this condition, so he must go.Therefore, he could only simply reply to the message and reject the other party.As for whether this news would appear a little ruthless, a little direct, he even told the other party directly that he had a fiancee…This mysterious software was a platform used by the children of rich and high-ranking officials to date women. His information was not a secret at all, and the other party would not know who he was.And since she knew who he was, how could she not know that he had a fiancée?Moreover, it was nice to say that each of them knew the opposite party’s purpose. There was no love here, just desire.He just spoke directly, could the other party still be angry?Impossible.Because when you are rich enough, you don’t need to talk flattery to please women, to carefully observe the other party’s expression and attitude, for fear that the other party will be angry and unhappy.On the contrary, she will always observe your expressions and attitudes, trying to please you. She is the weaker party.#PLEASEREADTHISATWONDERNOVELS.COMSo Su Mingyuan didn’t bother to think about how the other party would react when she received this reply.Anyway, looking at those attractive black silk legs, he would just make an appointment next time.At the same time, Xiao Ran, who had left Fairview Residence, was still not mentally prepared to apologise to Su Mingyuan in the end, and said to Nick who was driving, with a upset voice, “Nick, find a quieter restaurant for lunch, and I’ll think about it when I go back after dinner.”#PLEASEREADTHISATWONDERNOVELS.COM“Boss, I checked the Internet, and there is a lakeside restaurant nearby with good reviews and a quiet environment.”“Well, just go there,” Xiao Ran waved his hand impatiently and said.At the same time, Su Xuelan was on his way to the lakeside restaurant.When Su Mingyuan’s Rolls-Royce arrived at the lakeside restaurant, Xia Xueqi just arrived and met him when she got off the bus.And the car that Xiao Ran was in, driven by Nick, also happened to be parked not far from the door of the restaurant when the two met.Su Xuelan’s car arrived a little later than Xiao Ran’s, and parked further back, just in time for him to see the whole situation.***
