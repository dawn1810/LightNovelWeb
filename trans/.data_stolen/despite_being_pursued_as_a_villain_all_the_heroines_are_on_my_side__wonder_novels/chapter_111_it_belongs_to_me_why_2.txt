Obviously their date this time went so perfectly. Their feelings were  steadily increasing, the surprise and romantic occasion he prepared for her was right in front of her eyes, but to abandon her at this moment without mercy ……Even if he could give her hints and suggest that his next actions were all an act.After all, what he showed in front of everyone in Ming City was this persona of a dude who was arrogant and infatuated with Liu Mengning, and he acted this way just to keep this persona from being broken by Liu Mengning.The real face of me is still only known to you, Xueqi.But will this still seem a little too …… cruel?Xia Xueqi was actually thinking more than Su Mingyuan at this time.She had two options, one was to do the same as Su Mingyuan thought, tell Liu Mengning that she was just being forced to date Su Mingyuan, and then dump him right away. The date would end without a hitch.She could also take this opportunity to give Su Mingyuan a step down, so that he did not have to continue to tangle with this complicated situation, and perhaps even because of this initiative to relieve the situation, she could enhance the good feelings for herself in Mingyuan’s heart.The second option, of course, was to directly have a showdown with Liu Mengning, saying, I and my fiancé are dating, do we still need your Liu Mengning consent?Xia Xueqi actually knew in her heart that the first choice was undoubtedly better from the aspect of reasoning.Because Liu Mengning was a terribly chaotic variable, and Mingyuan, under the compulsion of the world’s will, he had only one choice in order to minimise the variables and pull back the plot,That was to comply with the persona.So even if she had a hard confrontation with Liu Mengning, Mingyuan wouldn’t cooperate with her, but instead she might become a joke herself.However,……, once she saw Liu Mengning’s playful smile, she thought that the surprise that Mingyuan had prepared for herself tonight had gone down the drain, a perfect opportunity to greatly enhance their relationship; a perfect round for her to finally have a reason to launch an active attack on him in a dignified manner. But, it was going to pass from her hands.Thinking of this, she felt unusually unhappy. The first time she saw him, she was so happy.But turning her head, once she saw Su Mingyuan tangled and difficult expression.Her heart, or softened.She chose to give in.Not because of Liu Mengning’s smiling but secretly aggressive attitude, but because she did not want to see Mingyuan so embarrassed and distressed because of her.She re-lived everything in this life, dating him, punching Xiao Ran in the face, even daring to openly hold hands with him in front of Xiao Ran, refuting Xiao Ran’s face.Wasn’t it just to take it out for him, to make him happy, to make him stop showing such a difficult side in the future?Snap!She took the initiative to open Su Mingyuan’s hand, and the familiar aura of high coolness and pride returned to her body in this instant.She took a half step back, clutching her chest, glanced at him with disgust, and clarified to Liu Mengning, “Dating this guy is just something that the elders in my family forced me to do so, to show them, otherwise how would I have let him hold my hand and would have blushed for him?”“So that’s how it is, Xuexue. I thought you were lying to me when you told me all those bad things about him before!”Liu Mengning smiled happily and brightly like a small child, her innocent smile was so infectious, as if she really believed Xia Xueqi’s explanation.As expected of a big star actor, there was not a trace of acting.Su Mingyuan also finally reacted, while in the heart thanked Xia Xueqi’s initiative to solve the problem. The internal good feeling for her rose substantially at the same time. Walking towards Liu Mengning obsessively, he revealed deep affectionate eyes. “Mengning, how wonderful, how wonderful!”“Mengning, what a wonderful chance encounter, please don’t misunderstand, that woman Xia Xueqi and I are only temporarily acting under the pressure of our families, you are the one I really love.”In order to not avoid Xia Xueqi too hard, Su Mingyuan did not say more fleshly statements at that moment. For example, “Her beauty is less than you by a million times”, “although she is a born star, but in front of you, the bright moon, she can only dull the light” and so on.One should know that in the past, Su Mingyuan, in order to chase Liu Mengning, this kind of love words were shot out one after another, because he thought that since Liu Mengning likes to act, like to pursue art, then these literary statements are obviously a good way to cheat her.But just hearing Su Mingyuan’s fleshy words to Liu Mengning, “You are the one I really love,” even though she knew he was acting, Xia Xueqi felt her heart dripping blood. She unconsciously clenched her fists, her nails pinching deep into her flesh.Just then, Su Mingyuan, both because of compliance with the persona and because of a careless moment of quick talk, pointed to the amusement park behind him where the lights were flashing to create a dreamy atmosphere, and said to Liu Mengning.“I wonder if I can have the honour to invite you to visit this dreamy castle with me?”After saying these words, he was slightly stunned and felt a bad premonition.But, then he felt that there shouldn’t be any bigproblem.According to his infatuation persona, when he saw Liu Mengning appearing here, he would definitely go up and invite her for a while.And if Liu Mengning did not appear to change too much, she should be as usual to maintain a respectful and even slightly disgusted attitude towards him, smile and coldly refuse.Wait!Who knows whether or not Liu Mengning had also appeared to be a crumbling change in some place?Su Mingyuan suddenly felt a chill down his spine.At the same time, Xia Xueqi pretended to walk to the side as if she did not care, but secretly gritted her teeth, nails embedded deep in the flesh, heartache that penetrated deep inside her soul.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe corner of her eyes glanced at Liu Mengning after hearing this, froze for a moment, then shallowly curved the corners of the mouth, revealing a smile for which both men and women would be moved. Then, she nodded to Su Mingyuan and said, “Good.”
