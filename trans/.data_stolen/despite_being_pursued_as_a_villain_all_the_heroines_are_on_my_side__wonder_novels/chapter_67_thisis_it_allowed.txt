I knew it!I knew it!Whether it is past life or this life, no matter how many times it is repeated.My white knight Su Mingyuan, his answer will never change!Murong Hongxue gritted her teeth and grabbed Su Mingyuan’s hand tightly, suppressing her feelings out of fear that she would not be able to control her emotions and kiss him on the spot.The more she felt that she was dirty, the more she yearned for a light to shine on her. She wanted to be cared for and appreciated.But…But…… But she could no longer get salvation from this sentence.Because she thought she was dirty.Obviously, the previous life’s favourable impression and strong emotion were all due to the man in front of her and it was clear that she fell in love with the light that illuminated her.But due to the influence of the overlord and the protagonist’s halo, all of her affection for Su Mingyuan was transferred to Xiao Ran!Even if she had not had any intimate contact with Xiao Ran in her previous life until the time she killed him.But mentally and spiritually, she felt that the self that had liked Xiao Ran was no longer clean.It was dirty!She didn’t deserve this light right now!Especially when Su Mingyuan appeared in front of her as a white knight, he looked so tall and handsome, the golden sunlight and pure white clothes made him look as dazzling as the sun.And what qualifications does she …… have to dare to kiss him?Su Mingyuan looked at Murong Hongxue’s expression and smiled slightly inwardly.Oh, what underground queen, snake and scorpion beauty? She is also touched by my words.But ah, the one who flirted with you is the white knight, and what does it have to do with I, Su Mingyuan?Time to go!I still need to inform my unworthy son.Su Mingyuan gently pulled away from Murong Hongxue, who was holding on to him, and turned to wave and say, “Miss Murong, if there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first.”At this moment, Murong Hongxue suddenly rushed forward into his arms, hugged him firmly, and the slender arms wrapped around his back were strangling him like a tight hoop, which caused him some discomfort.She is after all…  still can’t restrain it.Should I dare ask for a kiss, at least… A parting hug, is it okay?Su Mingyuan was stunned at this moment.“Uh… Miss Murong, you’re…?”He loosened his hands in a trance, feeling somewhat stunned.Murong Hongxue pressed her head sideways against his chest, feeling the temperature of his body and breathing his scent.I can’t help but need more of his warmth and comfort, and I’m quite unwilling to let go of him.But her seductive face showed a cruel and cold expression at this time.“Although I don’t know who you are, since you know my past,  I don’t think that you can move me with such a sentence! ”“I want to check if your heart is cheating me!  If you dare to lie to me….. ”She slowly smiled ruthlessly at Su Mingyuan, then pressed her ear against Su Mingyuan’s left chest and listened to his heartbeat.In fact, the one whose heart was beating so fast that it was about to pop out of her chest was clearly herself.So …… you are using this method to confirm whether I am lying or not?After a long time, Su Mingyuan, who was frozen in place with his hands dumbly placed in mid-air, asked a question.“That… Miss Murong, are you sure? ”It was only after she had taken a deep breath and had his warmth and breath firmly imprinted in her mind that Murong Hongxue eventually gave up and walked away from his arms.“By the way, I suddenly forgot to ask you before, what’s your name?”“Just call me a knight,” Su Mingyuan replied with a smile.“You can go now.” Murong Hongxue’s attitude suddenly became very indifferent.“Oh… oh.”Su Mingyuan nodded, a little confused, but did not think much about it, and left the study room.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comWhen he left, Murong Hongxue finally couldn’t hold back any longer, and her face showed a hint of unrequited love.Yes, she felt that she was not worthy of him, and she did not dare to expect to be his wife at all. Even if she could only be his underground lover in this life, she would be willing and would feel extremely satisfied.It was also the first major conference call between Xia Xueqi and Su Xuelan, one of whom took Ruoruo as his helper and the other was coming to Murong Hongxue to help himself, but was not prepared to exclude them.Ruoruo qas too gentle and kind, she only hoped to be by Su Mingyuan’s side, as long as she always had a place for her in his heart.Even if Su Mingyuan married another woman as his wife. Although she would feel extremely uncomfortable, she would choose to accept the situation in silence and be willing to serve as the mistress.The same goes for Murong Hongxue.Because of her childhood experience, she felt that she was not worthy to be Su Mingyuan’s wife, and she could also accept other women to become Su Mingyuan’s wife, willing to be a mistress and be Su Mingyuan’s underground lover.However, Su Xuelan and Xia Xueqi, no matter who they were, had strong personalities and a strong desire to control, they would not be willing to be a mistress, and would not be willing to share Su Mingyuan’s love with others.Even if they had to accept that Su Mingyuan had another woman, they had to be the main palace!The two of them were known to be two good sisters too well, and they knew each other too well.Although Murong Hongxue did not dare to covet the kiss of the white knight at this moment, she did not dare to ask for more.Because she felt dirty and unworthy of his light.But her intense emotions, overflowing emotions, couldn’t be controlled.The more she thought back to his embrace and the smell, his warmth, the gentleness of his soft whispers.A certain desire was burning more vigorously.But then she suddenly understood.Since I am not clean anymore, I am already dirty.Then going to Mingyuan, going to her white knight to do something unclean things, is also allowed, right?She remembered that Su Mingyuan had used a mysterious software to make an appointment with a young lady before, but he was interrupted by Xia Xueqi in the middle.This mysterious software was developed and managed by her subordinates as one of the underground industrial chains.As the underground queen of Ming City, she had a lot of intelligence, and naturally she knew about this matter for a long time.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAnd now, she was going to use the little sister’s account that Su Mingyuan met for herself, next time, next time, and many times thereafter.She would be the little sister who was asked out by Mingyuan, go on a date with him, accompany him to dinner, chat and watch movies, and accompany him to the big bed in the hotel…Of course, before that, she must definitely disguise herself, just like Mingyuan liked to wear the suit of a white knight.She would also dress up, change her temperament, and then put on a mask similar to the kind used in masquerade balls that only covered part of the eye detail, to accompany him to relax and make him happy ……Tomorrow, after meeting Xiao Ran tomorrow, she would launch a date invitation to Mingyuan as that little sister.Thinking of this, Murong Hongxue bit her lower lip lightly, and her hands gently caressed the proud mountain, and a trace of excitement flowed from her eyes.She couldn’t wait any longer.***
