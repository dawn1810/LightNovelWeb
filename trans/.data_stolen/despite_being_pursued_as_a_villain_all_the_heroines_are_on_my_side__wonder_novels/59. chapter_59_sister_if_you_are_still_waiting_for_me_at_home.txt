-bonus chapterJust when Su Mingyuan nervously clenched his fist and felt uneasy.The system finally made a noise:[Your final rating for this performance is: Pass.][You’ve got 400 villain points and equal number of strengthening points.][Host cheer up! I’m sure you’ll keep up the good work and get a better rating on your next performance!]“Phew ……”Su Mingyuan let out a long sigh of relief.I’m fine. I don’t need to eat a table.And 400 points was equal to the sum of his previous two performances!Yes, what was he nervous about just now. Even if the second and third plot were ruined by sister and Murong Hongxue, he at least still let Xiao Ran pretend for a whileEven if the system didn’t give him a perfect evaluation, no matter how you think about it, it couldn’t be a failure.But he was expecting a perfect evaluation.He didn’t expect to only pass.The system had just calculated it for so long, perhaps because the performance’s evaluation was not much different from the average or even a tiny bit!Just a little bit, his performance evaluation may rise to the perfect.‘If I had known…If I had known, I would have brought Ruoruo.’Now it seemed that even Su Xuelan, this very good sister, could not be trusted, and might screw up his performance.Although Ruoruo was an undercover agent, except for conveying information to Xiao Ran, she had always been very obedient in front of him.And as long as she appeared, her identity as an undercover agent would greet Xiao Ran with an invisible face slap.Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan decided that in order to improve the final evaluation of the next performance, he must bring Ruoruo!These heroines with different characters, except Ruoruo, couldn’t be trusted!But in the next performance, he would not make this mistake, and calculate all the possible causes of the variables, arranging them away so as to not bother him.Then he would bring Ruoruo and get the perfect evaluation!Ah, suddenly I miss Ruoruo’s food. Let’s go back and ask her to make some supper for me.As for how to remedy the situation, well, get some sleep and think about it tomorrow.Su Mingyuan was about to ask the driver to start the car, but Su Xuelan had already sat in, closed the door, pressed the button to raise the opaque soundproof windows that cut off the front and rear rows, and locked his two bodyguards outside to prevent them from getting in the car.Now, they were in the same closed soundproof space.“Sister, aren’t you going home in your car?” Su Mingyuan asked curiously.“Going home? Mingyuan, speaking of it, how long has it been since you moved to your villa to live?”“I’m afraid of getting scolded by my dad when I go home,”Su Mingyuan touched his head and said with a foolish laugh.“They miss you too. I think you should go back and see them.” Su Xuelan pinched his cheek with affection swirling behind those beautiful eyes.If Mingyuan always stayed in his villa, how could she get close to him?If Mingyuan didn’t come home often, she would find an excuse to move to Mingyuan’s villa.She couldn’t always let Ruoruo have all the advantage, while his sister could only watch like an audience.Thinking of the scene of Mingyuan and Ruoruo kissing in the car, Su Xuelan felt that the air in the car turning slightly hot.No, it was her heart that was already slightly restlessToday, she came out, hit Xiao Ran’s face to help Mingyuan vent his anger, which must have made Mingyuan’s favor for her rise again.Now, shouldn’t her sister take advantage of her status and take good care of her brother?Xia Xueqi left a note before mocking her as Mingyuan’s sister besides hugging, nothing could happen between them.Can’t do it?I’ll do it for you!Su Mingyuan was still answering Su Xuelan’s conversation at this time: “Sister, when I am free, I will go back to see my parents.”Su Xuelan had already opened her arms and hugged him tightly. The plumpness that was about to break her clothes pressed against his chest, making him feel incomparably elastic and soft flesh along with the warm heat oozing out of them.While her sister’s fairy-like beautiful face was facing his cheek, and the seductive lips like rose petals spit out a charming fragnance.It left him at a loss for a moment.“……Sister?”“Mingyuan, I was still a step too late today, will you blame me?” Su Xuelan stared into his eyes and asked with remorse.No, sister, in fact you come early and late made no difference, the most important thing is that you shouldn’t have come.But facing his sister’s concern and self-blaming look, Su Mingyuan couldn’t really blame her.I can only say that I don’t blame you this time. Next time, you have to listen to my brother and stop appearing on the plot.Su Mingyuan’s mood didn’t get too bad because this performance was destroyed by Su Xuelan.When he wasn’t very good at acting last week, he still stumbled and accumulated enough villain points.He then interacted with Xiao Ran in a lot of drama, and this week the target also needed less than half of the villain points.He had taken the time to figure it out, and estimated that if he could get around 300 villain points at the end of each performance, he would be able to save almost the remaining 50,000 when his character died.As long as he doesn’t have the mentality that he must get a perfect evaluation every time and must save enough villain points to go home within half a year, he doesn’t need to panic at all.Let’s just take it slow and enjoy two more years of acting life.And although he only scored 200 points in the first two performances, even if he was disrupted by his sister Su Xuelan this time, he still scored 400 points. What did this mean?It meant that as long as he learned from this experience, and dealt with all the risks and variables before the show.Even if he didn’t do his best acting, playing casually, he could also easily get a good evaluation.A mere 300 villain points?The final assessment of jumping back and forth between pass and fail?They won’t appear again.From the next show, I will get a good rating and above every time, and I will get a 1000 villain points or more, right?The previous failure and the resulting psychological gap were mainly because he was too confident, too careless, and pushed himself too hard.So Su Mingyuan smiled and said to Su Xuelan, “Sister, how could I blame you? I was so happy when you vented your anger for me and slapped Xiao Ran in the face!”Son ah, you do not fight for yourself, so do not blame me for being hit hard on the face by my sister. Ah, anyway, it is not me who hit you.Hee hee.Su Mingyuan’s mentality was always adjusted very quickly, and he could always find fun quickly.And Su Xuelan was relieved when she saw Su Mingyuan’s expression that did not seem to be a fake and sincere smile.It was not that she didn’t want to appear early, but before Xiao Ran slapped Su Mingyuan in the face, she stopped him one step at a time.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBut this part of the plot did not have her and Murong Hongxue appearance.She didn’t dare to rush in and ruin the plot about Xiao Ran and Mingyuan.And as long as the incident of Mingyuan being slapped in the face by Xiao Ran happened according to the plot of the novel, then she would add an additional plot to vent Mingyuan’s anger and make Xiao Ran be slapped in the face, and the will of the world could not blame on Mingyuan.After all, he had dutifully played his villain role, and he was indeed slapped in the face by Xiao Ran. As for why he turned around after this…This had nothing to do with Mingyuan.But she couldn’t tell Mingyuan for such a reason, telling him that she didn’t mean to let him be frustrated before appearing, and she couldn’t let the will of the world involve her behaviour on Mingyuan’s head.That was why she felt so guilty and hugged him so affectionately.Not only to let him feel her warmth, but also to understand his condition.Then……“Mingyuan, don’t blame your sister.”Feeling the unnatural reaction of Mingyuan in her arms, her slender fingers gently caressed his cheek, and exhaled beside his lips and said, “I suddenly remembered that our sister and brother used to sleep together in the same bed when we were young, but when we grew up, we became a little more divided…”#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com“Can you come home and sleep with me tonight, Mingyuan? We can lie on the same bed as siblings and relive our childhood together… We need to have a heart-to-heart talk.”Su Mingyuan already felt that something was wrong at this time.In his heart, he already regarded Su Xuelan as his sister, and he didn’t have the slightest fantasy about the hug she held.But she held her so tightly and so forcefully, her eyes, tone and even her movements revealed a hint of ambiguity that shouldn’t exist between siblings.She even exhaled softly like a lover from her lips. Moreover, she wanted to go home and lie on the same bed with him…“Sister, are you…are you a little too excited?Although we are siblings, it’s normal to be close in childhood. But…we’re so old, can we still sleep on the same bed?”“Mingyuan, it’s precisely because they’re siblings that they sleep in the same bed with a clear conscience and don’t feel anything. Or, are you treating you and me…”Su Xuelan’s eyes slightly raised, revealing a charming and imperceptible expectation.“No…No…” Su Mingyuan hurriedly shook his head, suddenly thought of something, and said, “It’s just…I just told Ruoruo before I went out that I wouldn’t spend the night elsewhere, sister, she must have the lights on now. Still waiting for me, so…”#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comSu Xuelan chuckled lightly, restraining the expectations in her eyes, and still looked at him tenderly, but said in a tone of indifference, “There’s no reason, since Mingyuan, you can’t bear to make her wait, then make a call now and tell her not to wait.”***
