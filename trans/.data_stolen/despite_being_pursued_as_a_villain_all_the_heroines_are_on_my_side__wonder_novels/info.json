As long as he plays well according to the villain\u2019s setting and completes the plot, he can get villain points, and he can return to earth if he saves enough 100,000.\nUnexpectedly, Su Mingyuan, who had saved enough money, unfortunately, encountered a turbulent flow in time and space when he crossed back to Earth, and the time went back to his first day as a villain.\nEverything has to start again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely a matter of starting over; the required villain value is less than half what it was the last time, and my acting abilities have improved significantly since the last time. I\u2019m able to deliver stronger performances and am able to acquire a greater number of villain values more quickly\u2026\u201d\nSu Mingyuan is optimistic and confident.\n\u201cLet see, I will do my best to taunt the male and female protagonists to hate me and then be punched in the face by them!\u201d\n\u201cSee if I don\u2019t do my best to ridicule, make the male and female protagonists hate me, and then hit me crazily in the face and step on me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen it comes to acting as a villain, I\u2019m a professional!\u201d\nTo begin, the first step is to attempt to harass the male protagonist\u2019s sister, so that the two create an intense dislike for me.\nHey, what\u2019s wrong with you heroine?\nNot only do you not resist, why do you seem to\u2026 enjoy it?\nCan you be serious!?\nI\u2019m a villain!\nWait\u2026 wait!\nWhy, apart from you, the way other female protagonists look at me seems to be wrong?\nThey came up one by one as if they were going to\u2026 eat me?",
