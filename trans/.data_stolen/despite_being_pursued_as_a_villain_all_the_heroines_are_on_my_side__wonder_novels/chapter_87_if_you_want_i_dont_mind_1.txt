If you want, I don’t mind…Murong Hongxue finally held back her anger.She wanted to immediately send someone to secretly assassinate all Xiao Ran’s men currently in Mingjing to vent her emotions.But for the sake of the bigger picture, she endured it.She couldn’t afford to make a mistake.This guy was the son of destiny, the protagonist of the world. If he was forced to leave China in a hurry, the world was so big, and they would never find a way to him.If he chose another way, overturning the chessboard and disobeying the rules of the game, and before escaping, he decided to use his 40 years of Radiant Jade skill to make a big impact.For example, if he kill Su Mingyuan, who had made him the most unhappy recently, to vent his anger, then she could only watch helplessly. At most, they would die with him.Because of Xiao Ran’s power, he was an invincible existence before the ancient Wu family and the hidden sect appeared.Even in the hidden sect of the ancient martial family, only the top dozen or so people could barely match him.And now it was not about eliciting their existence.Because once the behemoths hidden behind them were fully exerted, the situation in China would be turned upside down in an instant.The most important thing was that the plot line belonging to Mingyuan would be completely destroyed because of this, and there would be no solution left.Mingyuan would be killed by the will of the world before Xiao Ran was killed by the ancient martial family!And maybe in the end, Xiao Ran, the son of destiny and the invincible fighter, might not be caught by the ancient martial family like the previous life.So at this time, she couldn’t continue to touch Xiao Ran’s few remaining subordinates, and she could only leave him alone, which completely angered him.In order to truly kill Xiao Ran, they still had to cut his wings and mess up his foundation just like what they had planned in a tacit understanding before.For example, in the security company that Xiao Ran currently runs, Murong Hongxue was involved. Then she would slowly infiltrate this company and replace her subordinates in important positions.Xiao Ran would think that they still belonged to his company, but this company would have long since changed its owners, and they would all obey Murong Hongxue’s orders!And the film and television company he planned to open in the future, Xia Xueqi would definitely join in, slowly infiltrating his company.There were other contacts and resources that he would strengthen in the future…They would all find a way to take it and turn it into their own, leaving him a shell in name only.At that time, Xiao Ran would think that these were all his forces, and that he had established a huge network of forces, but he wouldn’t know that all his forces had already been brought under their control.He would be a loner!And after waiting for a while, after they cultivated, they would have the ability to kill Xiao Ran with one blow.At that time, they would give him a fatal blow, completely ending the life of the Son of Destiny!But……She couldn’t move Xiao Ran’s subordinates, but it wasn’t that she couldn’t continue to weaken his power.Murong Hongxue first communicated with Xia Xueqi on the phone, and then called Xiao Ran.“Hello, Miss Murong?”“Xiao Ran, I changed my mind about the 50-50 split last time.” Murong Hongxue’s first sentence made Xiao Ran’s already bad mood a bit worse.“Six to four points! I’ll give you four!”“Miss Murong, that’s what we agreed on at the negotiating table, then why!”“Because of the stupid thing you did yesterday. In order to settle with the Su and Xia family and make your security business run smoothly, I need to spend more resources and connections. Understand? Stupid!”In the face of Murong Hongxue’s blunt insults, Xiao Ran suddenly became speechless, unable to refute.“Heh, also, the previous condition requires you to apologise to Su Mingyuan in public, and you have to add one more.”Murong Hongxue’s suddenly rising tone made Xiao Ran’s heart tighten again.“What conditions?”“Call yourself and ask your good friend Xia Xueqi! Do you know how much scorn and ridicule she received in the Su and Xia family during the day she ran around for you?”Murong Hongxue said with a sneer, “Oh, I’ve only said so much, you’d better consider whether or not to agree to these new requirements within the next few days, and don’t come to me again when the time is over. Then don’t blame me for not giving you the slightest chance to renegotiate.”“Dududu…”When the call was hung up, Xiao Ran was left dazed.Because of what happened yesterday, the profit distributed to Murong Hongxue would be increased by 10%, and originally he only needed to apologise to Su Mingyuan, but now he might have to pay more.But when he thought of Xia Xueqi, of another girl who worked hard for him, endured the scorn and ridicule of others, he felt that he should not be depressed here.He was a man!He couldn’t rely on women all the time!Thinking of this, he called Xia Xueqi.“Hello? Xiao Ran, do you have anything to do with me?” Her tone sounded a little tired, not as cold and indifferent as before.When Xiao Ran heard such a tone, he seemed to be able to imagine how much she suffered for him.“Xueqi, that… You have worked hard for me, I just learned from Murong Hongxue that you…”“It’s nothing, I don’t blame you, we are partners. You have to help me control the Xia family, don’t you? Xiao Ran, don’t be so depressed, I trust you.”Even at this point, she still didn’t forget to encourage him.When Xiao Ran heard this, his heart was really moved.“Xiao Ran, I have tried my best to help you win. Among them, Murong Hongxue also helped a little. The Su and Xia family can temporarily tolerate your overstepping, but there is one condition.”“What conditions?”“You have to take the initiative and sincerely apologise to Su Mingyuan, admit your mistakes, and it must be in a public place and in a crowded situation, so that everyone can see it. And this apology… can’t be too stingy, you should understand, right?”Although he had already made some psychological preparations, Xiao Ran still shuddered when he heard this.Not only do I have to bow my head to apologise to that bastard in front of everyone, but I also have to prepare a heavy gift…Why!Why!His fist was clenched hard, but what was the use of it?Could he still fly over and beat Su Mingyuan into patties now?“Xiao Ran, I know this must be a great humiliation for you, and you must be very unwilling to accept it, but…”***
