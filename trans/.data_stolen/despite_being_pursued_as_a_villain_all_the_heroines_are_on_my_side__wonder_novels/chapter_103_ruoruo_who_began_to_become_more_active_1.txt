After comforting Ruoruo, Su Mingyuan came up with a general plan, then contacted Su Li and handed over the arrangement to him.Naturally, this kind of thing had to be handed over to the only confidant he trusted in order to reassure him.In the free time that followed, he took a piece of good jade from his collection room and began to practice.Although even with the blessing of the best jade, if the cultivation was compared with the purchased items of the system, there was indeed a big gap.But he reckoned that the small drop would make a river, and the accumulation would be fruitful. At present, relying on the beautiful jade collected by him, he worked hard to cultivate for more than a month, and it was not a problem to increase his skill for a year.It was just that the more one practised, the lower the bonuses and effects brought by these good jades of the same quality, and the speed of practice would be greatly reduced.Unless he used the two most precious jades in his collection room, which belonged to the category of spiritual jade, and the dragon marrow jade that he had been wearing since birth, he wouldn’t see any improvement.This was also the reason why Xiao Ran chose to come back from abroad.He had absorbed too much of the top-quality jade outside, and his Qi had been almost pure and condensed to the extreme. The top-quality jade outside could no longer bring him any improvement.And spiritual jade, which was similar to heaven and earth treasures, was only available in China.Also, this was the reason why he could still patiently endure Ruoruo being an undercover agent beside Su Mingyuan.Unless he find those ancient martial families and hidden sects, it was difficult to find a precious and rare treasure such as spiritual jade even in China.So the last time he was in Hongyun Building, under the stimulation of Su Mingyuan and the temptation of spiritual jade, he couldn’t help losing his mind, and he challenged Su Mingyuan on the spot.Therefore, when Su Mingyuan turned into a white knight and gave him the spiritual jade as his junior brother, he would cherish it and become so emotional, feeling that his junior brother was so kind to him.More than ten days had passed since the second week. In addition to acting, Su Mingyuan’s spare time was not full of waste, and he only occasionally relaxed.In addition to turning into a white knight to remedy the plot, and the necessary interaction with other heroines, the rest of his spare time was basically used for cultivation.Otherwise, there was such an undefended beauty and darling Ruoruo at home, dangling in front of him every day.Even if Ruoruo was a little shy and nervous about the next few steps, as long as he spent more time on the strategy and presses step by step, how would Ruoruo not be eaten by him yet?Uh… It seemed that he couldn’t eat Ruoruo either, so he could only let Ruoruo take the initiative to eat him.That was fine.Compared with him eating Ruoruo, letting a pure and innocent girl like Ruoruo overcome her nervousness and shyness to eat him.This difficulty had obviously risen a lot.The difficulty had suddenly increased, and now Ruoruo was so obedient again.So Su Mingyuan subconsciously felt that there was no need to worry so much.Anyway, sooner or later, she would be in his own pocket, a dessert on the plate.Su Mingyuan was not in a hurry, but after returning to the room, Ruoruo began to worry about gains and losses.The progress between sister Xueqi and brother Mingyuan was so fast, and brother Mingyuan had already taken the initiative to find her on a date…Obviously now she was the champion. As the only girl who lived with Mingyuan’s brother, she had an incomparably huge advantage.Compared with the other sisters, she had far more time together than they and Mingyuan’s brother.But……When she thought that sister Xueqi and brother Mingyuan would spend another whole day outside tomorrow, she suddenly felt that she was not ahead by much as she was alone in the empty room.Ruoruo bit her lip and felt that her progress on this side seemed to be a little… slow.Although what she thought at first was not to fight or rob, as long as she could be a little woman who accompanied brother Mingyuan.But if there was a chance to get more love from brother Mingyuan, she would be extremely lucky and happy to be his first woman…If something like this could be fought for, why not take the initiative to fight for it?Thinking of this, Ruoruo finally made up his mind.She couldn’t go on like this any longer!Just thinking about using meticulous care to make Brother Mingyuan inseparable from him was simply not enough!Constrained by the will of the world, if I want to go further with my brother Mingyuan, I must become more active…Maybe… Maybe I should try to overcome my shyness and be bolder the next time brother Mingyuan asks me to help…No, not maybe, but must!I have to overcome the shyness in my heart, I have to be more proactive and bold…Because…I want to get more love from brother Mingyuan…I want to be loved by him. I long to be touched by him, to be…Suddenly, many chaotic and red-faced fantasies appeared in my mind.As these pink fantasies continued to fly and expand like bubbles, occupying the entire mind, Ruoruo only felt that her brain began to become dizzy, and began to think more and more.Even her cheeks became hot, and her body felt weird again. Those slender fingers slid down unconsciously, wanting to vent, to become more comfortable…Woohoo, brother Mingyuan, it’s all your fault, it’s all your fault!Ruoruo did something bad again tonight and became a bad girl again…………………The next day, Su Mingyuan got up from the bed refreshed.Opening the curtains, the mist in the morning was gradually dispelled by the light of the morning sun. Today was a great weather, suitable for a date.In the morning, Su Mingyuan spent time in cultivation.When it was almost noon, he put on a handsome outfit and prepared to go out.He and Xia Xueqi made an appointment to meet at the restaurant.Before going out, Ruoruo grabbed the corner of his clothes and asked reluctantly, “Brother Mingyuan, can you come back earlier today?”Su Mingyuan thought of today’s schedule, scratched his nose, and said, “I can’t say, maybe I will come back later tonight, or maybe… come back tomorrow morning.”“Ming… come back tomorrow morning?”As soon as these words came out, Ruoruo’s eyes were suddenly covered with a layer of water mist, and she was about to cry pitifully.Is sister Xueqi’s progress so fast, and brother Mingyuan is ready to not come home at night?Woo woo woo…Seeing tears flashing in Ruoruo’s eyes, Su Mingyuan hurriedly comforted her and reassured her, saying that he was just joking, and he would definitely be back tonight.Ruoruo’s tearful offensive worked, but she didn’t feel good about it.When she thought that brother Mingyuan might not come home at night, he might have planned to be with sister Xueqi from the very beginning…If Ruoruo felt a heartache, it was impossible to be sad.“Brother Mingyuan!”She raised her tearful face, and in Su Mingyuan’s surprised expression, she suddenly stood on tiptoe and kissed him forcefully.Incomparably enthusiastic, incomparably serious, as if she wanted to turn her own taste into a deep imprint at this moment and engrave it on Su Mingyuan’s lips.For a long time, their lips didn’t part.Ruoruo bowed her head a little shyly because of her bold move, her face flushed.But she quickly overcame this mentality. Even though she was nervous and shy, her cheeks were hot and her pupils were trembling, she bravely raised her face, stared into Su Mingyuan’s eyes, and boldly said her heartfelt request.“Brother Mingyuan, every time you leave home, can you give me a parting kiss like this?”At this moment, the girl who was shy but had the courage to ask for a kiss was incomparably beautiful under the golden sunlight.At this moment, Su Mingyuan looked at Ruoruomei’s blushing cheeks obsessively, pinched her hot cheeks, and said dotingly, “Okay, as long as you give me another kiss, I’ll agree to your request.”He gave her a charming smile.At this moment, Su Mingyuan’s smile also touched Ruoruo’s heart, as if time had stopped, and only his smile was shining in front of her in the whole black and white world.So she couldn’t help but step forward and hug him tightly, kissing him strongly and passionately.Su Mingyuan responded with the same tenderness and affection.At this moment, even the sun became gentle and less dazzling, and the breeze swept across the treetops, accompanied by the dancing leaves, making a sound like a melodious wind chime.In the distance, a pink smiley balloon was floating and rising leisurely in the picture with the blue sky in the background.Ruoruo’s heart finally got a small temporary satisfaction from these two kisses.Moreover, every time brother Mingyuan would leave home, he would give her a parting kiss first.In this way, no matter if Mingyuan goes to see that sister, his first kiss, the first smell would be left on my lips.
