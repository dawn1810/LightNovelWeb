Su Mingyuan left in a daze.If he did not leave, Liu Mengning would take him down step by step.This Liu Mengning was such a master that it was hard to stand her attack.This damn sweet woman, why did she break through my heart defence so easily?Even so, after leaving, Liu Mengning’s figure still appeared in his mind.You are the hero in my mind.She said this to him.If this sentence had been uttered by a stranger, Su Mingyuan would not have felt so touched.But… that was Liu Mengning.Those common experiences and feelings over the past two weeks, those time spent together……Once, as a white knight, he helplessly fulfilled all Liu Mengning’s whim requirements.But, if it wasn’t for his heart’s desire, why would he do those things? Wouldn’t it be enough to just save her?Isn’t it that he himself  crazily wanted to accompany her, to make trouble, and to laugh wantonly?Liu Mengning’s words aroused the memories of the past. The apparitions of the past seemed to overlap with reality, and it seemed that it was not only Liu Mengning who said these words to him at that moment, but also the one who was the purpose of the previous week.You are my… hero.It was like confessing to him.What the hell? Casually saying such misleading words and looking at me with such a serious and gentle gaze, you will only make me mistakenly think that you really like me!Somehow…… I can’t help it.Su Mingyuan took a deep breath, raised his head and looked up at the blue sky above. The clouds slowly hovered in the sky and seemed to be transformed into Liu Mengning’s charming smiling face at that moment.Calm down.Calm down.Can’t keep thinking about her anymore.Su Mingyuan took out his mobile phone.If it was difficult to get rid of the image of Liu Mengning in his head at all times, then…He dialled Xia Xueqi’s phone.Xueqi, it’s been a long time since I saw you, I miss you so much!I miss your kiss and hug so much!“Hey, Xueqi, I haven’t seen you for several days. Are you free today? Ah, there is no time? That’s okay. By the way, I’ll tell you something. Aren’t you going to take Xiao Ran to Liu Mengning’s film investment meeting tomorrow…”Xia Xueqi was busy, so Su Mingyuan could only regretfully make another appointment next time. Then, he hurriedly discussed business with Xia Xueqi and arranged tomorrow’s performance in advance.In his thoughts, since Xia Xueqi still wanted to use Xiao Ran’s power and money abroad to take over the Xia family, it was best to be lovely to him so that he would be easier to catch.In tomorrow’s investment meeting, Xia Xueqi could help Xiao Ran a little to help him get a spot as an investor.After hanging up the phone, Su Mingyuan sighed.“Busy, busy.”He clicked on the phone number of the next person in the address book.Murong Hongxue.In the office, Xia Xueqi helplessly put down her mobile phone, looked at the documents and schedules, and glared at Murong Hongxue next to her.This damn woman, it’s rare for Mingyuan to take the initiative to ask me out on a date.Because of her “enthusiastic help”, I can’t spare the slightest time to get close to Mingyuan now!Seeing the anger in Xia Xueqi’s eyes, the corners of Murong Hongxue’s mouth rose slightly, and her mood suddenly became happy.Fortunately, she played this move, which made Xia Xueqi too busy to date Mingyuan.Otherwise, with her advanced progress, if she would date Mingyuan this time, maybe the two of them would fall in love naturally.……This was unacceptable for her, Murong Hongxue!Although she never thought about fighting for the status of the main wife in the past, she felt that being a little woman by Mingyuan’s side, a little lover was enough.But if there was a chance to get Mingyuan’s first night…she was not only very interested in this, but also very courageous!From the first time she met the white knight Su Mingyuan, she went directly with him to a level that no one had ever seen before.Seeing Xia Xueqi’s helpless and angry face, she felt fortunate in her heart.Fortunately, I made the right move. Although I was also pulled by her and suffered with her, but, humph, now you, Xia Xueqi, must be so uncomfortable.At that moment, the phone rang in her pocket.Murong Hongxue took out her mobile phone and her face suddenly changed when she saw the caller’s name.“Sorry, my knight, I’m busy right now…” She almost cried and said this bitterly.She never expected that one second she was still laughing at Xia Xueqi in her heart, and the next second, the same thing would fall on her head.Xia Xueqi hugged her chest and watched her bitter expression after hanging up the phone, and the corners of her mouth rose slightly by 0.01 centimetre.This smile exuded glee at the suffering of others.Humph!Murong Hongxue glared at her uncomfortably.You goddamn bad woman, if you hadn’t pulled me and made me suffer, I would have started to have a more in-depth communication with Mingyuan now!Xia Xueqi rolled her eyes contemptuously.Didn’t you do it yourself? If you hadn’t teased me like this first, I’d already hold hands with Mingyuan and have a sweet date out of nowhere!The two looked at each other, snorted coldly, and turned their backs at the same time, not wanting to see each other’s angry faces.These two sisters continued to attack one another……“Oh, why is Hongxue busy too?” After hanging up the phone, Su Mingyuan sighed helplessly.Fortunately, even though Xueqi and Hongxue were busy, he knew that there was a well-behaved baby at the house. At that moment, she must be waiting for him to return like a little rabbit.Su Mingyuan returned to the villa, changed his clothes , and opened the door.“Brother Mingyuan, you are back.”No matter when he came back, he could always hear Ruoruo’s lovely voice, and he could always see her happy little face, trotting up for a hug.“Well, I’m back.”Su Mingyuan hugged Ruoruo’s soft body, rested his head lightly on her shoulder, and buried it in her hair.He took a deep breath and smelled the good fragrance on her body, and most of the phantoms of Liu Mengning in his mind were driven away at once.Ruoruo, my Ruoruo……Ruoruo didn’t ask him why he came back so early this time, raised her face from his arms and pointed to his slightly pursed lips.“Brother Mingyuan, I want to kiss you!”Su Mingyuan smiled slightly and pinched her earlobes. “Didn’t I say that you have to take the initiative to kiss me every time, my little baby?”“Huh! Brother Mingyuan, you always like to tease me like this!”Ruoruo pursed his mouth and gave him an angry white look, hummed twice in a low voice, and took the initiative to kiss him.With Ruoruo’s excuse, Su Mingyuan could kiss her unscrupulously now without worrying about being deducted from the Villain Points.He hugged Ruoruo to the living room, and the two kissed passionately on the sofa.Once their lips parted, Ruoruo’s complexion turned red, and her eyes shone with intoxicating nectar. Her little tender feet gently rubbed his leg, and she plucked up the courage to say in his ear timidly, “Brother Mingyuan, I specially wore white silk today, if… if you want…”Boom!Looking at Ruoruo’s shy and timid eyes, Su Mingyuan had completely lost his fighting spirit now. There wasn’t a single trace of Liu Mengning remaining in Su Mingyuan’s mindShe had already been thrown away 180,000 miles away a long time ago!WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
