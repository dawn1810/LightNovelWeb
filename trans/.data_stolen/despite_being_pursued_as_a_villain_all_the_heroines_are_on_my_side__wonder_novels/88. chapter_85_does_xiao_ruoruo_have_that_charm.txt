Xia Xueqi didn’t know yet that her arrangement today not only helped her achieve her goal, but also brought her unexpected ecstasy.Ruoruo didn’t know that as long as she was willing to endure the shyness in her heart and take the last step boldly, Su Mingyuan would not refuse at all.Because in this week, there were successive failures, and the benefits and temptations were constantly delivered to his door.Su Mingyuan’s mentality had unknowingly evolved a bit like a scumbag man.“Brother Mingyuan, have you eaten? If you haven’t, I happened to cook a little more?”She was always so thoughtful and so lovely.Ah, Ruoruo, although I know you are acting, you are really like a little angel!“Okay, let’s eat together.”The dining table was very big, but Su Mingyuan and Ruoruo were sitting next to each other.Although she seemed to smell the scent of a woman from Su Mingyuan, Ruoruo didn’t feel too uncomfortable this time.Not only because Su Mingyuan abided by the agreement and came back early.And……Brother Mingyuan came back without even having lunch. He must have had a bad time with Sister Xueqi on the date, right?Hehehe, I didn’t expect that such a smart elder sister Xueqi would suffer loss one day.Ruoruo turned her head slightly and looked at the side profile of Su Mingyuan, who was sitting beside her while eating her carefully prepared delicious food, and a satisfied smile slowly crept up on her face. She swayed her feet happily.Su Mingyuan was indeed a little hungry, and now he was more and more inseparable from Ruoruo’s craftsmanship.She really understood the truth that if you want to enter a man’s heart, you must first enter his stomach.While eating, Su Mingyuan became a little distracted.He didn’t know if it was intentional or not.Ruoruo’s dangling little feet always brushed past his legs from time to time, and her clothes were tightly hugging her slender body. She wore cool clothes in summer, and her white and smooth skin kept rubbing against him…In short, Su Mingyuan was eating delicious dishes but he couldn’t focus on them in front of her.In addition to the warm kiss and caress with Xia Xueqi before, and the undefended appearance of this real delicacy around him…“Ah, brother Mingyuan, don’t move!”Suddenly, Ruoruo pulled his sleeve and said.“What’s wrong?” Su Mingyuan turned his head and looked at her suspiciously.He didn’t know that because of the confusion just now, a grain of rice was stuck on his face at the moment.“Anyway…Brother Mingyuan, you…don’t move for a while, okay?”Ruoruo’s face suddenly turned red.Then she stood up, holding the corner of her clothes shyly with both hands, but her upper body boldly bent down towards Su Mingyuan.The shy and cute face slowly kept closer in front of him, and his slightly pursed lips were trembling with the urge to rush up and eat her.The red lips fell lightly on his face, bringing a warm touch.Ruoruo ate the grain of rice naughtily, then raised her head slightly. Facing Su Mingyuan’s face, her eyes as deep as the spring seemed to be covered by a hazy mist.“Brother Mingyuan, didn’t you teach me what to do when there is rice on my face? So…”She bit her lower lip shyly, but the amorous feelings in her eyes gradually took on the charm of mature women.Then……She ate the grain of rice, and Su Mingyuan also tasted her delicate lips.The feminine smell on brother Mingyuan’s body should be covered up by me.…………However, what Ruoruo could not have expected was that the flame roused by her kiss was not as easy to control as before.Not long ago, he was with Xia Xueqi, and he almost couldn’t control himself, and was about to explode.And now she took the initiative to set the fire on his lower body, burning the flame that had not been extinguished even more vigorously.“Ruoruo.”“Hmm? Brother Mingyuan, what’s wrong?”“Well, can you…”In the middle of the kiss, Su Mingyuan leaned close to Ruoruo’s ear and said something.Ruoruo blushed suddenly, from the neck to the base of her ears. She was too shy to even look at him.“Brother Mingyuan, then…that kind of thing, no…no way, I’m not ready yet…”“But if you don’t touch it there, if you don’t save it, it will explode!”“What!”Ruoruo cautiously stretched out her hand, and suddenly let out an exclamation. She retracted her hand in fear, muttered something , and a trace of panic appeared on her face.But this fire was caused by her, and she couldn’t bear to see brother Mingyuan feel so uncomfortable.What if, what if it really exploded as Brother Mingyuan said?Even for future happiness, she should…Seeing Su Mingyuan’s distressed appearance, Ruoruo finally made up her mind.She turned her head slightly and didn’t dare to look into his eyes. At this moment, her lovely face was so hot and crimson that it was about to let out steam, and her eyes, which were covered with mist, were so charming that they were about to drip water.She carefully stretched out her slender and tender little hand, and asked shyly and tremblingly, “Brother Mingyuan, this… is this okay?”…………The relationship between Su Mingyuan and Ruoruo had made another huge step forward!As he lay in bed at night thinking about that moment, he couldn’t help but start fantasising.If you are willing to use your hands this time, won’t the next time…Thinking of this, he felt that he was a little uncontrollably excited again.No!What am I doing!He slapped himself savagely.I am not a waste, why do I keep thinking about these things?It’s time to get ready to do something serious, Su Mingyuan!Thinking of this, he suddenly remembered his date with Xia Xueqi during the day. He hadn’t sent her the intimate photos she needed, and what if she wasn’t ready to fulfil the agreement because of his actions?How can I forget Xia Xueqi when I have Ruoruo, it’s really inappropriate!He quickly sent Xia Xueqi the photos he took at the lakeside restaurant, and then called her.“Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for your call? Su Mingyuan.” As soon as Xia Xueqi spoke, she didn’t even call Mingyuan, her cold tone seemed like she was questioning a prisoner.“I’m sorry, Xueqi, didn’t I think about it all afternoon after I went back? Although it was an accident, it was true that I had gone too far, and I was entangled with an uneasy heart for a long time. It was not easy to drum up the courage to make this call to you.”Since Su Mingyuan faintly had the intention of taking the second path, his attitude towards Xia Xueqi was much better at this moment, and he was not as vengeful as before.Reflecting all afternoon?The corners of Xia Xueqi’s mouth rose slightly when she heard his words.I think you have been reminiscing about the corners of my lips and my body all afternoon, right?Hearing that there was no response from the other end of the phone, Su Mingyuan couldn’t help but ask, “That.. Xueqi, is our previous agreement still… valid?”Listening to Su Mingyuan’s cautious tone, and imagining how fascinated he was after he went back, Xia Xueqi’s mood suddenly improved a lot.I have the charm that only a big sister can have, do other women have it? Does Ruoruo have it?She was not going to investigate the reason Su Mingyuan called her so late, nor was she going to tease him and make him angry, so she smiled lightly and said,“Do you think I’m a woman who doesn’t keep her word?”***
