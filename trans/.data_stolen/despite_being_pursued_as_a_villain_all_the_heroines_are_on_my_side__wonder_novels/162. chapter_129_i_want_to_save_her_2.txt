Su Mingyuan, who should have been just a nobody  whom no one cared about, might instead consolidate his fame because of the continuous singing videos, and be completely remembered by a small number of people.One song, another song.The person who listened to the song was fascinated, but the person who sang waited for the person he wanted to see.Liu Mengning took Liu Xi’s hand and walked around and appeared on the opposite side of the street.“Hey, Sister Xi, look there!”Liu Mengning pointed at the crowd gathered not far away in surprise. When she saw the familiar and handsome figure in the centre of the crowd, the smile on her face became even brighter.“It’s Xiao Bai singing! Sister Xi, hurry up, let’s go and see!”Liu Mengning’s voice went up slightly, like an oriole singing cheerfully on the branch.The two walked quickly to the intersection, just as the green light was on, Liu Mengning took Liu Xi’s hand and was about to pull her quickly across the sidewalk.At the same time, Xiao Ran, who came out to hang out, also happened to appear on this street by accident and coincidence.When he saw the younger brother in the centre of the crowd, his expression was a little surprising.But, when he saw Liu Mengning who was crossing the sidewalk, his heart was full of ecstasy!What excited him even more was that a rider was delivering food at the intersection. Perhaps because he was in a hurry, or because he didn’t notice the red light, he suddenly slammed into the centre of the road at an extremely fast speed. The driver of a large truck who was crossing the road was frightened and he flicked the steering wheel, taking a sharp turn to slow down, so as not to collide with him.But, it was precisely because of this sharp sway that the truck suddenly tilted slightly upside down, but it did not fall down in the end. In general, it collapsed towards the side of the road.And this side was exactly the sidewalk that Liu Mengning and Liu Xi walked on.The goods that fell from the sky like a landslide smashed towards the two of them. At that moment, Xiao Ran’s eyes narrowed and he felt the opportunity.As long as I save Liu Mengning here, maybe I can have a romantic date with her.She has an unparalleled beauty. She is a hot star in China and is sought after by countless people. She is also the eldest lady of the Liu family. If she can become my lover, if she can become my lover…At that moment, Xiao Ran set off without hesitation.He wanted to appear like a hero at this moment and save Liu Mengning!At the same time, there was another figure that rushed to the scene of danger earlier than him.When Su Mingyuan saw the delivery man rushing in front of the big truck, he immediately bought a one-day experience card of 20 years of kung fu from the System and started to run.Although he was still not as fast as Xiao Ran after twenty years of skill, and due to his early departure, he arrived at the scene one step faster!At that time, those heavy goods like rocks had just begun to fall!However, Su Mingyuan’s pupils shrank at that moment.Although the goods on the large truck looked small, they had a strong momentum, like rolling stones falling from a high mountain.However, the collapsed and smashed cargo covered only a section of the sidewalk, and in the original plot of the novel, only Liu Mengning and Liu Xi were in danger.But now, he didn’t know why, there was still a little boy with a scared face on this road.He seemed to have left his mother’s hand because he saw the green light on the sidewalk before, and happily trotted to the other side of the road to wait for her.The most important thing was that the little boy was at one end, while Liu Mengning and Liu Xi were at the other end!Time was urgent, and Su Mingyuan only had time to take care of one person.At that moment, less than one tenth of a second was left for him to react. He could see Xiao Ran’s ecstatic face that had appeared in front of him, and he could also see the fearful and desperate prayer of her mother behind the child.#pleasereadthischapterwondernovels.comIn fact, there is no need to save him, right? He is not standing in the centre but on the side.Maybe the falling goods can’t hit him? Maybe he won’t get hurt at all, just a false alarm?Why should I worry so much about such a stranger?Or Liu Mengning’s side is more important.Saving her at this moment will definitely increase her favorability, and it will be of great help for me to win her in the future!I should go save her!Should I go… save her?But Xiao Ran…I know him well, it is impossible for him to leave Liu Mengning alone to save this innocent little boy.What to do……Shouldn’t there be an answer already?At the moment when he finally made a decision in less than 0.01 seconds, Su Mingyuan complied with the choice from his heart.Boom!The cargo collapsed and fell, sending up smoke and dust.Su Mingyuan and Xiao Ran shot at the same time.—–WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
