Su Mingyuan breathed a sigh of relief when Xia Xueqi’s matter was finally settled.Next, I just need to act coquettish to my sister tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and let her and Xia Xueqi go to Murong Hongxue for dinner.Then in the Hongyun Building the night after tomorrow, Xiao Ran and I will no longer be disturbed by any variables!So now let’s review the plot that is about to take place in the Hongyun Building.Two nights later, the Hongyun Building would display more than ten antiques for purchase.#pleaseradthischapteratfoxaholic.comSome of them had been clearly certified to the historical age, but some were not testable, and it was not clear whether they were genuine or fake.In this exhibition, there would be a mysterious ancient jade whose origin and collection value couldn’t be studied.It was said that this ancient jade was originally a family heirloom treasure of a destitute child,but now they were really short of money so it was put up for auction.Experts couldn’t tell when this ancient jade came from, and which famous hand it came from, but it was in good condition, warm in colour, and it gave people a sense of relaxation and joy, which was extremely miraculous.This mysterious ancient jade naturally attracted the attention of many people.Su Mingyuan, who had always been fond of beautiful jade, would naturally not miss this exhibition.Xiao Ran originally came back because he couldn’t collect good jade that could improve his skills abroad. Hearing that the mysterious ancient jade displayed in Hongyun Building was most likely the legendary spiritual jade, he naturally would not miss this opportunity.And then……According to the original plot.Su Mingyuan was naturally slapped in the face by Xiao Ran here.Although Xiao Ran had not yet established a power in China, he had a lot of money!In the competition of auction items at this kind of exhibition, it was natural that whoever had the most money was the boss, and Xiao Ran would meet the owner of the lot by coincidence in the past two days, help him a little bit, and win the favour of the owner.So in the price increase competition that seemed to have no end, the owner finally decided on the candidate and decided to sell this ancient jade to Xiao Ran.On the other hand, the face of Su Mingyuan, Young Master Su, was to be stomped under the feet of Xiao Ran in the eyes of so many people, which would give him his momentum and reputation.So now, the risk of the female protagonists has been eliminated. Now I can see that the only possible problem is that if the owner changes his mind and succumbs to his background and power, what should he do if he does not help Xiao Ran?As for Xiao Ran?I know the son raised by me the best. Is there anyone in this world who can understand Xiao Ran better than me?He only suffered so much grievance at the Blue Rose Bar a few days ago, and now he finally had a chance to slap his face back in such a public place, would he just let it go?Moreover, this was a fair competition. He, Xiao Ran, slapped me in the face, and I have nowhere to find someone to reason with!So Su Mingyuan quickly called Su Li to arrange assignments.Although it was night, this loyal subordinate still did not have any complaints, and he never asked much, and worked diligently to complete the task he was assigned.Of course, he was so loyal, and Su Mingyuan would never treat him badly. Every time he completed his task, he would give him a large sum of money.There was no other way. Apart from money, he didn’t know how to reward Su Li. He might not have anything else, but he just had a lot of money.The next day.When Su Mingyuan got up from the bed and looked at the flickering sun outside the window, he felt as if God was telling him that his future was bright!In the next performance, he had foolproof plan, how could he usher in the darkness of failure?He went down to the second floor in a good mood, thinking about what he should do during the last day’s rest time?He must find a way to continue to enhance the relationship with Ruoruo and have more intimate interactions. She gave him hands yesterday. He would try to make her wear black stockings this time.#pleaseradthischapteratfoxaholic.comNo, Ruoruo, such a cute little angel should wear pure clothes. White stockings, and then try to get her to give me…However, all Su Mingyuan’s delusions disappeared when he saw the uninvited guest in the living room.“Sister, why are you here?”Looking at Su Xuelan sitting elegantly and dignifiedly on the sofa, he looked blank.“Hearing that from Mingyuan, do you not welcome me? Or… my appearance disturbed your house?”Su Xuelan’s eyes drifted towards Ruoruo, who was a little embarrassed by the side, and then looked at Su Mingyuan, with a bit of resentment in her expression.She didn’t know how far the relationship between Ruoruo and Mingyuan had progressed, but at least one thing she was sure of.They must not know how many times they kissed each other!And what about her?As Mingyuan’s older sister, she had yet to get a kiss from him!“Welcome, why not. By the way, sister, have you eaten breakfast? If you haven’t, I’ll ask Ruoruo to go to the kitchen to cook more for you.”Hey, I haven’t seen you for a while, I didn’t expect this little girl Ruoruo to go this far.Ruoruo what are you trying to do?To grab a man’s heart, you must first grab his stomach.Are you going to grab Mingyuan’s stomach first, and then slowly go a step further and start to take the initiative to serve him, clothe him, feed him, take a bath and rub his back… Let him get used to your presence, to get used to your care and service.Then one day he will find that he is so unaccustomed without you, and without your service, it is as if something is missing in his life, right?Su Xuelan really did not expect that Ruoruo could play so well.But……She didn’t plan to say anything here, but secretly decided to find an opportunity to move to this villa early to live with him.“It’s true that I didn’t have breakfast, so please go to the kitchen to cook more. I can also borrow Mingyuan and say some sweet words in this spare time.”Su Xuelan smiled gracefully and said gently to Ruoruo, but from her movements and subtle demeanour, one could see that she had completely regarded herself as the hostess here.“Oh, good, good.”Ruoruo nodded obediently and went to the kitchen to prepare another breakfast.Su Mingyuan didn’t say anything. He still needed Su Xuelan to help him. Of course, he would accommodate her at this time.Su Xuelan took his hand, sat down next to him, and said softly, “Mingyuan, it’s rare today that I don’t have time to do family affairs, so you can stay here with my sister all day, okay?”“Okay…Okay.” Su Mingyuan nodded in agreement.Hearing this answer, Su Xuelan suddenly showed a happy smile.Xia Xueqi’s saucy hoof and Ming Yuan’s two dates only lasted less than an hour.And I’m here all day!Now, it’s my turn!At the same time.Murong Hongxue took out her mobile phone and logged into the mysterious software. After a long time of nervousness and anxiety, she edited the information and sent an invitation to Su Mingyuan.Yesterday he was going on a date with Xia Xueqi. Should I finally have time today?Her eyes were fixed on the phone screen, for fear that she would miss the reply to the message. Her heart was full of shy nervousness and anticipation.However, after dozens of seconds, when Su Mingyuan’s reply appeared on the screen, her expectations suddenly turned into unspeakable anger.【Sorry, my sister wants me to accompany her today, let’s make an appointment next time. 】At this moment, seeing this reply, Murong Hongxue really couldn’t help but want to throw her phone in anger, and disregarding the image of a lady, she wanted to curse out loud.***
