He felt that it was time to go further, so he couldn’t help but slowly approached her, and the restless salty pig hand sneaked towards Xia Xueqi’s jade hand.Xia Xueqi immediately took a half step back, dodging his sneak attack.Xiao Ran’s hand crossed an arc in the air and caught nothing.As a result, the originally harmonious scene suddenly became awkward because of Xia Xueqi’s small step backward.The smile on Xiao Ran’s face suddenly froze.“Xueqi, I’m sorry, I…”He looked at Xia Xueqi with embarrassment, and a hint of doubt and incomprehension.He felt that the relationship between the two of them should have reached the step of holding hands, but why did she dodge?Xia Xueqi endured the nausea and bitterness, and wanted to continue acting in disguise.But in Xiao Ran’s eyes, her eyes and expression still showed a trace of disgust.“I’m sorry, Xiao Ran, I…”She explained with a trace of pain and disgust on her face, “Last time I had to go on a date with that bastard Su Mingyuan, and he held hands, I was almost sick and sick to the point of vomiting.”“Even after I got home, I washed it with various detergents and even disinfectant water 180 times, but now I feel extremely uncomfortable and disgusting whenever I think of my hand being held by him.”“I’m sorry, Xiao Ran, I really can’t overcome this psychological obstacle and hold hands with you…”There was a trace of apology in Xia Xueqi’s eyes.She didn’t want to deliberately show such a weak appearance in front of Xiao Ran. She only wanted Mingyuan to see this appearance, but she had to act like this for the sake of the overall situation…She really felt sorry for Mingyuan…However, Xiao Ran was completely wrong, thinking that the apology in Xia Xueqi’s eyes was an apology to him, and that the disgust in her eyes and expression was aimed at Su Mingyuan.He immediately accepted this statement, and while feeling incomparably pity for Xia Xueqi, he also raised deep anger and even hatred for Su Mingyuan!The dog thief Su Mingyuan! Treating Xue Qi like this even caused her to have a psychological barrier to holding hands with me!Xiao Ran clenched his fists, and there was a trace of hatred in his eyes.You wait for me! Let’s wait and see. When my power develops, I will make you completely regret all your actions!After saying goodbye to Xia Xueqi, Xiao Ran was still in a fit of anger, and it was not until then that his younger brother reported another matter to him with his mobile phone, that he diverted his attention.“Boss, look, the man singing on the overpass in this video is your mysterious junior brother?”In the past few days, the video of Su Mingyuan playing guitar and singing on the flyover that day had become a little popular on the Internet.The beautiful voice, which was extremely immersive even after being distorted by uploading, coupled with the mysterious and handsome dress, made countless people wonder who the man in white under the mask is.Although if there was no follow-up exposure, this heat would soon turn into a wave and be submerged in the tide of the Internet.But at least in the past few days, Su Mingyuan had really become a little popular, and that video had been spread all over the circle of friends of many people.Xiao Ran took a look at the phone and immediately confirmed that the man singing in the video was the junior he just recognized today.It turns out that the younger brother is not only proficient in the mysterious arts, but also so talented?Xiao Ran exclaimed inwardly.He didn’t think too much about why Su Mingyuan’s front foot was still a mysterious person in the Xuanmen, and he said that it should not be too much karmic entanglement with Hongchen, and his back foot appeared on the flyover to openly sing.Haven’t there been such classic scenes in many storybooks?Mysterious Xuanmen master is in a game world or something.But I have to say that although it seems a little bad to describe a man like this, the voice of the younger brother is really like the sound of nature.Listening to such a beautiful song, Xiao Ran’s anger just because of Su Mingyuan dissipated a lot.On the other hand, as soon as Xia Xueqi left the Burning Flame Mansion, her face suddenly turned completely cold, as cold and cruel as frost.Anyone could see how bad her mood was at this moment.Let Xiao Ran and Xiao Ran be there for nothing, this bastard still wanted to hold her hand!It made her feel sick and nauseous!No, I really want to see Mingyuan now. I want to be hugged by him, held by him, kissed by him.I want to date him…Xia Xueqi immediately called Su Mingyuan, but Su Mingyuan was not there, and it was Ruoruo who answered the phone.Xia Xueqi immediately knew that Su Mingyuan was disguised as a white knight to do something else.So of course he wouldn’t take Su Mingyuan’s cell phone with him. Before leaving, he handed it over to Ruoruo, saying that if anyone contacted him, he would say he wasn’t there.It was easy to find where Su Mingyuan was on weekdays.He was either at the villa or went somewhere else in his cool Rolls-Royce.And every time this world-unique Rolls-Royce stops, it would cause a bunch of people around to take pictures and show off in the circle of friends.It was not difficult to find that car, but if one find the car, you would naturally find his people.If not, she could call directly.But Su Mingyuan, who was pretending to be a white knight, went there, and she didn’t have time to find him for a while.The last time Su Xuelan was able to bring Li Shuang to the venue where Su Mingyuan sang was because he openly sang on the flyover and attracted a large crowd of people, so it was easy to find him at that time.But this time, no one knew where Su Mingyuan went.Xia Xueqi didn’t know either.She had no choice but to suppress the depression in her heart and prepare to find Murong Hongxue.Because before Murong Hongxue, in order to vent her anger, silenced all of the second batch of subordinates that Xiao Ran had planned to use for her as a helper to help her control the Xia family, except the Viper.Now she had no choice but to ask for help from Murong Hongxue.However, just as she arrived at Lingxue Pavilion where Murong Hongxue was, she saw a swift white shadow flying past the door.White knight?Xia Xueqi confirmed that she had seen it right just now, that familiar outfit, that familiar body shape…Mingyuan, who she wanted to date with all her heart, turned into a white knight to find Murong Hongxue!#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAt this time, Su Mingyuan had already disappeared at the end of the street, and she didn’t even have time to call out to him!What made Xia Xueqi feel even worse was that an extremely ominous premonition rose in her heart at this time.What did Mingyuan disguise as a white knight to find Murong Hongxue?How long had he been in there?Are there any…Terrible expectations slowly emerged in my mind.At this moment, the calmness that Xia Xueqi had always maintained on her face could no longer be maintained.She hurriedly ran to Murong Hongxue’s study, she knew that Murong Hongxue always liked to stay there, and she wanted to go there to have a look immediately.She wanted to make sure if something happened between the two of them!During the run, her icy-white pretty face turned slightly red due to the nervousness and intense running. Her hair fluttered in the air, and her two jade hands tightly clasped the corner of her skirt.Better… Better if nothing happens…Must be!What was she looking forward to in her heart; what was she hoping for, what was she praying for.However, when she ran to the door of the study, what caught her eye in an instant was Murong Hongxue, who was leaning against the desk with a flushed face and an intoxicated aftertaste.And the very eye-catching, mottled spots sprinkled on her red dress.Xia Xueqi’s face turned pale in an instant.***
