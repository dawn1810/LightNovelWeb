“Isn’t the secretary’s responsibility to help the boss not only in his work but also in his life?”Xiao Ruoruo’s smile was as beautiful as a clear water hibiscus.However, a trace of vigilance rose in Su Mingyuan’s heart.‘The agreement you made with me before is already beyond understanding, and now you are still taking the initiative to go home with me?’‘Xiao Ruoruo, what are you thinking about, why can’t I see through you at all?’Still, he wasn’t about to refuse.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comIt was the same sentence, when the sugar coating was done and the cannonballs were fired, he, Su Mingyuan, was not afraid at all!“Okay, get in the car.” He nodded.Xiao Ruoruo opened the car door and sat beside him.The car that Su Mingyuan sat in was specially customised by Rolls-Royce, the only top luxury car in the world.Su Mingyuan was named Wind God.Young Master Su liked famous cars and wines, beautiful women and jade, so his car must be different.The model of this car was very cool. The gold label of Rolls-Royce reflected its brilliance under the sun. When the streamlined body was rushing, it felt as if it was hovering in the air, as if it was really the Wind God, leaving behind chaotic streams of wind.The car’s cabin was also large, with roomy and comfortable rear seats that folded down to form a large bed that was big enough for three people to roll around at will.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comMoreover, in such a spacious back row, Xiao Ruoruo didn’t choose to sit by the window after getting in the car, but instead sat directly next to Su Mingyuan.The buttocks outlined by the short skirt were close to his body, the overlapping thighs are plump and round, and the calves are straight, slender, and well-proportioned.The hip skirt outlined by the attractive curve of the buttocks was close to his body, overlapping thighs which looked plump and round. Her calves were straight and slender, proportionate and beautiful.While her long legs swayed slowly in the air, and occasionally brushed or rubbed against Su Mingyuan’s legs. Every curve drawn up and down was like Su Mingyuan’s chaotic heartbeat.At this moment, she seemed to have shed her innocence, seductive but dangerous.Su Mingyuan’s breathing couldn’t help being a little short.A peerless beauty was by your side, and she provoked you so intentionally or unintentionally, not to mention that her identity was still the sister of your enemy Xiao Ran, this… Who could resist?Su Mingyuan really held back.The temptation of a woman and the temptation to go home. Between the two, the temptation to go home was a little bigger to him.He was not a man controlled by his lower body.At this moment, Xiao Ruoruo leaned towards his ear and breathed out, “Brother Mingyuan, if you are tired, you can rest on my lap for a while.”‘Knee pillow?’‘Is there such a good thing?’‘Ruoruo, since this is your initiative, then I won’t be shy.’Su Mingyuan immediately lay on her lap without any hesitation.‘No matter how much sugar-coated bombs like this, I, Su Mingyuan, will take it all!’The first feeling when he lay down was that it was very soft, fragrant, and white, but this was not the kind of flabby soft, but had a slightly stretched elasticity.It could only be described with one word.Incredible.“President Su, you must be very tired from work on weekdays. Let me give you a massage.”Xiao Ruoruo’s hands lightly stroked his forehead and scalp, and began to massage him.‘Very tired?’As a playboy, Su Mingyuan, who never cared about company affairs, how could he be tired?But if you could lie on the beauty’s lap and feel the plumpness of her thigh, enjoying her massage service, why bother to expose it?At this moment, this double comfort made Su Mingyuan feel great enjoyment.‘I’m afraid that guy Xiao Ran can’t imagine that I’m lying on his most precious sister’s thigh right now while enjoying her massage, right?’Maybe even he had never enjoyed Xiao Ruoruo’s service!Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan couldn’t help laughing proudly.“President Su, what are you laughing at?” Xiao Ruoruo asked in a low voice.“Nothing. By the way, don’t you need to tell your brother about you and I going home?” Su Mingyuan asked.“I… will tell him later.” Xiao Ruoruo replied after a pause.Su Mingyuan didn’t ask any further, because at this time he was already engrossed in Xiao Ruoruo’s superb massage skills, and he closed his eyes so comfortably that he was about to fall asleep.So he didn’t notice that from the moment he lay on Xiao Ruoruo’s lap, her cheeks had been hot and crimson like the gorgeous sunset in the sky.In the past, Xiao Ruoruo could not have been so bold, and even took the initiative to tease the opposite sex.And today, she couldn’t resist forcibly kissing Su Mingyuan, and clasping her fingers tightly with him. So, she even made such a ridiculous agreement, and teased him in the car to let him rest on her lap…In fact, during the process of doing these things, she was so nervous and flustered that her heartbeat was thumping up and down, but…But this feeling was not bad.Looking at Su Mingyuan lying on her lap smiling and sleeping, Xiao Ruoruo gently stroked his cheek, showing a shy and sweet smile.‘Brother Mingyuan, we will definitely experience more of this sweet time in the future…’Half an hour later, Rolls-Royce Wind God stopped at the door of the villa.Su Mingyuan only felt that he had a good night’s sleep and got out of the car refreshed.After finding a servant to set up Xiao Ruoruo’s room, he went up to the second floor of the villa and opened a room that only he could enter.–monitoring room.In this villa, large and small cameras were arranged in both light and dark places, and all the pictures recorded and monitored by these cameras could only be viewed in this room.Su Mingyuan clicked on one of the pictures.That was Xiao Ruoruo’s room.Yes, although he just finished enjoying Xiao Ruoruo’s lap pillow and massage, he always kept a vigilance towards Xiao Ruoruo in his heart.A little pleasure of beauty could make him lose his mind and sink into a trance?That was so underestimating him.He, Su Mingyuan, was not a man controlled by his lower body, and never had been.So even though he just enjoyed Xiao Ruoruo’s benefits, as soon as he entered the villa, he immediately abandoned her and came to the monitoring room, trying to find out something.Because today’s Xiao Ruoruo was too unfamiliar, too mysterious, and too unpredictable for him.Why did she have so many abnormal and strange behaviours, and what was she thinking in her heart?At this moment, he might be able to find out.in the room.Xiao Ruoruo remembered what Su Mingyuan asked in the car just now, and after thinking about it, she decided to call Xiao Ran to explain.If she took the initiative to explain, but Xiao Ran would not be suspicious again.But if Xiao Ran later found out that she didn’t go home at night and was staying in Su Mingyuan’s villa, then it would be difficult to explain it clearly before convincing him.“Beep… Beep…Beep…”After a few rings, the phone was connected.“Hey, Ruoruo, what’s the matter with the call?”“Brother, I probably won’t go home for the internship these days. I’m going to live in Su Mingyuan’s villa temporarily.”Hearing this, Xiao Ran suddenly burst into anger: “What?! Ruoruo, did that bastard Su Mingyuan force you? Are you all right? I’ll save you right away!”“No, no, brother, don’t worry, just listen to me.”In order to reassure Xiao Ran, Xiao Ruoruo began to make up excuses, “Although I live in his villa, I won’t be liked by him, because Su Mingyuan is a… He is suave and can conquer many women, but in fact he can’t do it at all!”“Yes…is that so?”“That’s it. And brother, only if I live with him, I will have a better chance to help you steal his jade pendant and inform you in time when he arranges a plan against you.”
