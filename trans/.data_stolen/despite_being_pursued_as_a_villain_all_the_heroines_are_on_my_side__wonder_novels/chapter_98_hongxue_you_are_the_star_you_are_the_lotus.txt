Su Mingyuan guessed that what he said would definitely had an excellent effect on Murong Hongxue, and the fact was exactly as he guessed, and she successfully let her let go of her obsession with uncovering his mask.But he never expected that Murong Hongxue’s next actions after hearing these words would be so outrageous!I said to pay attention to the communication between souls, are you starting to turn fool?He originally thought, since Murong Hongxue had fallen in love with him this week, and because the will of the world was even more broken. He did not empathise with Xiao Ran.Then I don’t need to attack her, as long as I pretend to like her, I can use her love for me to make her like a good baby Ruoruo, and she will act with me when I need her in the future, and will not appear again. Such an accident this time?In the end, good guy, Murong Hongxue was tortured by death, and Su Mingyuan was completely stunned.Before his plan of becoming a scumbag started, he had already declared bankruptcy!For an expert like Murong Hongxue, such closeskin-to-skin contact was enough for her to roughly judge his mental activity and true thoughts the moment she asked this sentence!“I like my body a little bit, but I’m not enough to impress you… That’s it.”Murong Hongxue indeed guessed Su Mingyuan’s psychological thoughts through this method.Such a peerless beauty clinged so close to hisbody and made you play with her chest. If one said that Su Mingyuan did not respond to this, then he was definitely not a normal man.But could he say that he really likedMurong Hongxue now?Whether it was last week or this week, he had a very clear understanding of it.He was an actor, and at most he had an appreciative vision for these heroines, and at most he was mixed with a little delusion.Passionate about them?As a white knight, I have come into contact with them so much, and this kind of throbbing is a little bit more or less ambiguous.But to say it is love, it is love.That was far from true.“It’s okay, my knight, although you haven’t fallen in love with me yet, but since you are attracted to me and like my body, then…”Murong Hongxue suddenly smiled, and her other hand lightly pressed on Su Mingyuan’s hand. Under Su Mingyuan’s surprised eyes, she took the initiative to lead his hand to gently knead her actively.Feeling the other party’s sudden heartbeat, the smile on the corner of her mouth became more and more sweet and charming.“My knight, you can try to fall in love with my body first, and then fall in love with me as a person…”The words that came out of her lips were also full of charm and seduction.Su Mingyuan never imagined that Murong Hongxue could take the initiative to such a degree.But… dammit!Why is it so cool!Although his mind was still in shock and dazed, his body… had begun to disobey his mind.“My knight, you seem to like this, do you want more?”Murong Hongxue smiled softly and pressed her slender body up completely.There was no need to put his hands on her chests, because at this moment, they were close enough to hear each other’s heartbeats.There seemed to be a pink mist in the air.The atmosphere seemed very charming at the moment.Su Mingyuan’s heart beat was fast at this time.Murong Hongxue’s heart was also beating very fast.As if there was some burning feeling, the fiery thumping echoed in their chest, and the most primitive instincts and desires rooted in the deepest human beings were revived at this moment, connecting them together.Murong Hongxue took Su Mingyuan’s other hand and pressed it on her chest, handing over her two weaknesses into his hands.“My knight, do whatever you want…you, can, can, oh.”This provocative remark completely ignited the fire in Su Mingyuan’s heart.Su Mingyuan started to enjoy this beauty without any scruples, and let out a low groan, Murong Hongxue’s small mouth opened slightly, and at this moment, she also gently revealed a coquettish whisper.He held her in his hand.She also held him in her hands.Both of them were very happy, but they bothfelt that they were not satisfied enough.Murong Hongxue raised her head slightly, her delicate red lips were less than one centimetre away from Su Mingyuan’s lips.She licked the corner of her mouth lightly, and the wetness flashed across Su Mingyuan’s lips in a flash, causing his body and mind to sway again, and his face was full of blush.She smiled charmingly, and let out a scorching hot breath to the corner of his lips charmingly, and then invited him, “My knight, may I kiss you?”Su Mingyuan did not answer.But he didn’t need an answer either.Because at this moment, his breathing became more and more rapid, his movements became excited, his heartbeat became violent, and his blood was boiling.His physical response had already told her the answer.No one could handle such a situation.Su Mingyuan couldn’t either.His body, his emotions not only became more agitated by this invitation.His eyes were also telling her longing.What a charming little lamb.Watching him show such an insane state under the temptation of her own teasing, Murong Hongxue couldn’t help but hold his cheeks with both hands, and then slightly tiptoed.She kissed very tenderly.In the study, the faint smoke of incense seemed to have turned into a pink tulle at this moment, rendering the picture into a charming pink.Su Mingyuan and Murong Hongxue, who were slammed into the corner by the wall, went from the gentle tenderness at the beginning to the intense and in-depth passionate kiss in less than five seconds.Perhaps, this was also the fastest way to deepen mutual understanding.After a long time, their lips finally divided.But the ignited flames were not so easily extinguished.After a moment of breathing for the two of them, they clung to each other fiercely again.Once again, next time…Until a certain lip parting, Murong Hongxue suddenly held his face and asked, “My knight, have you now… become more fond of me?”Like it, of course I like it!How could I not like it?In Su Mingyuan’s heart, now Murong Hongxuehad surpassed her opponent and successfully leapt to a position second only to Ruoruo.No way, such an active bad woman was really sweet!Why don’t they say that men chase women across mountains, and women chase men’s interlayer yarn?Everyone knew which way was the shortcut to a woman’s heart, but the shortcut to a man’s heart was also not difficult to find!Murong Hongxue smiled lightly.Because again, she got the answer she wanted from his body.But if it was just like this, she would not feel so happy and satisfied.She slipped her hands down and wrapped her arms around his neck, she tiptoed lightly, gave him a soft kiss, and said, “My knight, I know what I’m doing is despicable. I’m just using my beauty and my body to make you greedy and obsessed. After all, the love you get is a castle in the air, illusory and can’t last.”“But I just can’t control it. Every minute and every second, my love for you is burning like a fire. And when I think that you haven’t fallen in love with me, you haven’t fallen in love with me; this flame gave my heart so much pain. So I couldn’t help it, I resorted to such despicable means, trying to make you fall in love with me and be fascinated by me.”Her voice became a little resentful and a little desolate, which made people sound with infinite pity.“My knight, I… I’ve become no different from the one I hate the most. I’m so mean, so dirty, I don’t know… Do I deserve to be liked by you?”“Is this me already dirty and broken?”Her pupils were trembling and confused.Her voice was so pitiful.Her expression was so helpless and painful.When she realised that what she had just done was the same as the kind of thing she had hated the most.The little girl who was buried in the dark abyss of decay, who was extremely humble and twisted, but who was extremely eager to be redeemed and to have a beam of light illuminated, returned to her once again.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comThe girl in front of her seemed to overlap with the girl in the rainy night in the previous week.She needed him.Even if it was just a hug,One affirmation.A gentle look.Su Mingyuan’s heart was deeply touched again. He had always boasted that he could separate work and life well.As an actor, he would work hard to complete his acting characters dutifully, but he would never be involved in the play, and he would never have any other feelings for the characters in the play.He was not an experientialist. He wouldn’t deeply immerse himself in the mood of the characters in the play, and he would not confuse the emotions in the play with his own.He could enter the play, and he could quickly withdraw from it.But when he appeared in a white knight suit, he actually played himself more than others.Compared with playing others, he was more like releasing his true self.And all the things he had been through, this one person he met.They were not actors, they were not NPCs, they were living, emotional people.At this moment, this layer of absolute defence in his inner structure, the psychological barrier, was quietly breached.In his heart, there was infinite pity for Murong Hongxue, and a trace of deep emotion.If the previous kiss with Murong Hongxue, the love brought by her charming body was a castle in the air, an illusion that would soon dissipate.So at this time, this touching and pity was completely fixing this illusory emotion and turning it into reality. #pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comHe couldn’t help holding her face, looked at her tenderly and pitifully, and said very firmly, “No, you’re not dirty, never.”“No matter how dark the night sky is, there will still be a star eager to illuminate the darkness; no matter how rotten the mud, a lotus flower can bloom without a trace of dust.”“Hongxue, you are the star.”“You are the lotus flower that is not stained with dust.”***
