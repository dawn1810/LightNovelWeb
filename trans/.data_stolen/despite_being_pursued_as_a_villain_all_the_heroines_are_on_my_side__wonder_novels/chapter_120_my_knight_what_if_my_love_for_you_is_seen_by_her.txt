Su Mingyuan said that he hated working overtime.I really hate working overtime.So the first thing he did after leaving the villa was to reach Lingxue Pavilion to find Murong Hongxue.Since it’s all overtime, why not choose the one that’s best done first?Presumably with my aura of a white knight, I told her to stay at home during the next performance and not come out to make trouble. Will Murong Hongxue be obedient to me?Maybe it will be the same as last time…In short, when he thought of this, Su Mingyuan didn’t feel that he was working overtime.Alas, facing Hongxue’s initiative this time, should I choose to reject or accept?Cough, cough.If she’s too enthusiastic, it’s indeed a little… difficult to refuse.After all, for the sake of my return, sometimes I have to accept what I should accept, and I have to enjoy what I should enjoy, right?Su Mingyuan walked towards Lingxue Pavilion excitedly.In Lingxue Pavilion, Murong Hongxue put down the phone in her hand, and a sneer appeared at the corner of her mouth.Just now, she called Xia Xueqi and asked her to come over and discuss how to help her control the power of the Xia family more quickly.Although Xia Xueqi repeatedly ruined her date with Mingyuan, who made them good sisters?This time, she repaid her grievances with virtue and sent most of her subordinates to help Xia Xueqi become the real head of the Xia family as soon as possible.Xueqi, apart from appearing on the stage when the plot is necessary, you should slowly and painstakingly fight with those from the Xia family these days!Don’t thank me, this is my duty as a good sister.Murong Hongxue was lost in her thoughts.“Hongxue, I’ve never seen a smile like yours before. Who offended you and made you do this?”A warm and mellow voice rang in her ears. Murong Hongxue turned her head, and was pleasantly surprised to see her white knight wearing a dashing trench coat, standing in front of her with a smile.The sinister smile on her face instantly turned into a bright sunny one. She stepped forward, clasped his strong arms with both hands, raised her head, and although she smiled brightly, she looked into his eyes cautiously.“I’m sorry…for letting you see this side of me. Knight, do you think I’m… a bad woman when you see me smile like that?”She really cared about her evaluation in Su Mingyuan’s heart.And of course Su Mingyuan was not stupid enough to say that he hated her sinister scheming.Rather, this underground queen who was domineering and ruthless in front of others was the only one who was cowardly and tender like a bunny when facing him. She cared about his opinion, as if he was her whole world.When you meet such a bad woman, how can you not love her, how can you call her bad?Under such a contrast, she is obviously so cute!“Of course not, Hongxue.” Su Mingyuan caressed her cheek gently, “In my heart, you are a beautiful lotus flower, a shining star, you are not bad at all. I guess the person who was plotted by you must have done something wrong and offended you, so he deserved your punishment.”Feeling the warmth of his fingers gently caressing her cheeks, and listening to his infinitely gentle and tolerant words, Murong Hongxue’s eyes gradually lit up, and the smile on her face became brighter and brighter.“Yes, that bad guy was punished by me like this, he deserves it, he deserves it!”“My knight.”She pressed her face close to his chest, listening to the sound of his gradually accelerating heartbeat, and then pulled Su Mingyuan’s hand slightly flushed and placed it on her heart. She said coquettishly, “It’s been a long time since you came to Hongxue, I really miss you so much.”Ah, this…Su Mingyuan really didn’t expect Murong Hongxue to give him such a surprise gift as soon as he came up.He didn’t do anything yet, but she just started to let him touch her towering…Besides, it seems that we haven’t seen each other for a day or two, so why do you look like you haven’t seen me for three years?Do you really love me so deeply?Su Mingyuan was a little surprised by Murong Hongxue’s enthusiasm.He didn’t know that she was disturbed by Xia Xueqi many times, and she could only watch the grand and romantic fireworks last night while guarding his boudoir. Not only did she get nothing, but she also sat and watched them enjoying their time. Murong Hongxue thought that she was going crazy!Even if he didn’t come to Lingxue Pavilion to find her today, she would take the initiative again!In the face of Murong Hongxue’s unrestrained enthusiasm, Su Mingyuan was of course the same as when he came here.But there was one thing to say. Hongxue could be described in one word:Awesome!“My knight, you don’t have to pity Hongxue, you can do as you want.”Murong Hongxue stretched out her jade finger and tapped him on his chest frivolously and playfully, giving him a ecstatic wink, which instantly evoked the flames in his heart.Now that Hongxue had already sent an invitation, how could he, Su Mingyuan, as an indomitable man, refuse?Su Mingyuan immediately enjoyed and played without hesitation.Murong Hongxue’s delicate body suddenly softened, her charming body fell softly into his arms, her face was blushing hot. She was like a very moving sunset, and he couldn’t help but want to kiss her.While wrapping one hand around his neck, she grabbed Su Mingyuan’s other free hand, placed it gently on another weakness of hers, and exhaled charmingly hot air in his ear, “My knight, it’s not good for this hand to be idle like this. Isn’t that right?”This charming little goblin really fascinates me!Su Mingyuan had to admit that as a man, he really didn’t have much resistance in the face of such an active, bold and enthusiastic beauty.Not to mention that after the last incident, he already had a good impression of Murong Hongxue.Now that the temperature was so hot, how could he stand it!He moved his both hands together, causing Murong Hongxue to let out a more seductive moan. She hugged Su Mingyuan’s neck tightly, her blurred eyes showing a hint of eager longing.Facing Su Mingyuan’s hot eyes, she smiled charmingly and emotionally, stood on tiptoe, kissed passionately, and had the most in-depth communication with him.“Murong Hongxue, why did you suddenly send so many helpers to me and invite me to your Lingxue Pavilion?”A cold voice came from outside the door.Before anyone arrived, the voice came first.Su Mingyuan, who was caught in a warm andwonderful experience, suddenly heard this familiar voice, and her brain froze. She suddenly woke up and realised that the person who came was Xia Xueqi, fiance of Su Mingyuan.#pleasereadthischapterwondernovels.comAnd now he was kissing Murong Hongxue in an extremely warm and passionate way!“Hongxue, someone is here.”Su Mingyuan felt guilty and wanted to let go and distance himself from Murong Hongxue.However, Murong Hongxue in turn hugged him even harder not to let him leave.“My knight, what if my deep love for you is seen by others?” Murong Hongxue’s eyes were burning with an unstoppable flame of incomparable enthusiasm.Then, she kissed again, deeper into his lips even more passionately.Su Mingyuan was blocked so much that he couldn’t say a word, and his whole heart trembled wildly under such tension.This is really outrageous!So exciting!But… I feel a little cool, what’s going on?So, as soon as Xia Xueqi walked in the door, what she saw was the scene of Su Mingyuan and Murong Hongxue kissing in a French style with no one else around them.She was completely stunned.WANT TO READ MORE???CLICK HERE
