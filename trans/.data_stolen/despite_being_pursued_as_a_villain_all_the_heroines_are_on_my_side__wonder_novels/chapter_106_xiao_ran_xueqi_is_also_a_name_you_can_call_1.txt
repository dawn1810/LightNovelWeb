Ruoruo save me!At this moment, Su Mingyuan kept calling back to Ruoruo’s sweetness and Murong Hongxue’s beauty in his heart, only then did he barely stop the restless throbbing heart.If he was attacked by Xia Xueqi first on the way to attack Xia Xueqi, what would he become?Joker?Wouldn’t n’t his behaviour and operation seem funny?Fortunately, although your Xia Xueqi is extremely beautiful and attractive, my Ruoruo and Hongxue are not bad!Even if you are a peerless beauty, Ruoruo and Hongxue are also the same.Hmph, if you want to get rid of my soul first, you’re still a long way off, Xia Xueqi!That said, Ruoruo and Hongxue were not around after all, and Xia Xueqi’s charming and seductive soul at the moment was really tugging at his heartstrings.Can you stop this throbbing from the heart just by recalling the beauty of Ruoruo and Hongxue?Obviously not.But Su Mingyuan thought that he could.He now felt that he was not touched by Xia Xueqi’s beauty at all.Just a joke, what beauties have I never seen?Did I see less of you female protagonists last week? Isn’t it still holding back and not being attracted to you?Don’t underestimate my determination as a man!The cinema was not far from the restaurant where the two of them ate. After walking on the pedestrian street hand in hand for a while, they arrived at their destination.During the walk, the two of them attracted the attention of countless passers-by, but neither of them paid much attention to it. Su Mingyuan even felt a little proud in his heart.No matter how cold and arrogant you Xia Xueqi are, you are still being held obediently by me like a little girlfriend?If Xiao Ran knew that the woman he liked and admired openly and intimately walked with me on this occasion, he would probably be half-hearted.This unsatisfactory stupid son, last week I helped you so much, and this week is also helping you wipe more ass.Then me and the heroine who was supposed to be with you hold hands for a walk, and by the way, grab her heart during the dating process, you should… don’t mind, right?Snort! If you don’t agree, you are disobeying human relations, disrespecting filial piety, and disrespecting parents!I, the dad, have paid so much for you, and now I just want to get a little gratitude and return from you, but you are still not willing?Then I will start with you, an unthankful and unfilial son, and there will be no more psychological pressure.Su Mingyuan thought proudly, and took Xia Xueqi’s hand to the ticket hall of the cinema.However, what he never expected was that when he arrived in the hall, he actually met Xiao Ran, who he was thinking about just now!Seeing Xiao Ran’s moment, Xia Xueqi’s face suddenly showed full disgust.Su Mingyuan suddenly felt an inexplicable guilt in his heart, holding Xia Xueqi’s hand a little unsteadily, and even wanted to throw it away.I was just joking in my heart just now, why did I really bump into it at this moment!He wailed inwardly.Suddenly, it happened so coincidentally, and he happened to be caught right in the face.Not to mention, if Xiao Ran became angry because of this, and chooses to break up the relationship with Xia Xueqi. If he couldn’t even make her as a partner, the subsequent plot would be completely messed up, and he would have no role to play!After all, Xia Xueqi was the female protagonist who had the most roles with Xiao Ran in the original novel, and also had the status of his fiancee.There were many conflict plots about the three of them!So Su Mingyuan subconsciously wanted to shake his hand, pretending to be unfamiliar with Xia Xueqi.If Xueqi could pretend to be unfamiliar with me at this time, or even belittle me, and instead try to please Xiao Ran, maybe it can beremedied…But for some reason, when he thought of such a picture, his heart subconsciously throbbed and felt uncomfortable.In his heart he didn’t want…. didn’t want this to happen.But if this was not the case, if he wanted to remedy it later, it would take a huge amount of effort, and he might not be able to remedy it…His inner balance was shaken violently at this moment. Should he remedy the plot or maintain intimacy?At this moment, Su Mingyuan had not found the answer.Although he still wanted to go home, he wanted to work hard to complete his acting tasks and actor’s work.But when his inner balance fluctuated under such circumstances, he had unknowingly established feelings and bonds with the world.While he was attacking these female protagonists, why was it that these female protagonists were also attacking him in turn?It was when he was extremely entangled in his heart, and under this inexplicable guilty conscience, he subconsciously wanted to throw his hand away.However, Xia Xueqi grabbed the palm of his hand forcefully, preventing him from escaping.Not only did she not choose to let go at this moment, but she held his palm more firmly and clasped his fingers tightly!Before, it was Su Mingyuan who grabbed Xia Xueqi’s little hand strongly and domineeringly after the test, and held her firmly in his palm.And at this moment, it was Xia Xueqi who grabbed his dodging palm strongly and domineeringly, preventing him from breaking free, not allowing him to escape, and tying him to her side!Boom-!As if a bell was ringing.Su Mingyuan’s heart was extremely shaken at this moment.The balance, which had been swaying in his heart, silently tilted to the other side at this moment.Some invisible and solid boundaries and barriers that had always been there, were quietly shattered at this moment.Su Mingyuan’s guilty conscience completely disappeared at this moment.Yeah, what am I being guilty of?How can a father be afraid of his son?Why should I panic?What’s more, Xueqi is my fiancee. What will happen if I hold hands with her on a date?The last time we were at the lakeside restaurant, we held hands. I don’t believe you, Xiao Ran, didn’t know the news afterwards.I see that you didn’t come to continue to make trouble with me after this, and there was no problem after that?Confidence, at this moment, returned to Su Mingyuan’s body.Not only was he not guilty now, but he also felt a little stimulated.He couldn’t even wait to see Xiao Ran’s miserable and struggling expression!As for the situation in the future, if the plot was messed up, he needed to make amends…Then make it up, as long as I’m happy, I’ll spend a little more time to make up for the plot, it doesn’t matter!He looked at Xiao Ran who turned around when he heard the sound, and was inexplicably excited,Unfilial son, watch this scene carefully, and then feel sad and painful. Who let you feel so satisfactory in Hongyun Building last time, so unpromising, ruining your father good deeds.#PLEASEREADTHISCHAPTERATWONDERNOVELS.COMThis is the punishment you deserve, you unfilial son!At the same time, Xiao Ran turned his head subconsciously when he heard the crisp high heels coming from behind him.In fact, he was in a very good mood today.Because although he encountered such humiliation in Hongyun Building two days ago, in just one day, everything had turned a corner.First, the younger brother stole his jade from Su Mingyuan’s villa and gave it to himself.Xiao Ran heard the rumour that Spiritual jade was stolen, and Su Mingyuan was furious in his villa with a hideous face.
