‘Faced with a powerful and wealthy man demanding compensation of up to 2.5 million yuan, and the dire consequences of offending him….It’s only logical that an average person would give in.’#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.com‘Like Xiao Ruoruo! Even though her personality had changed and her character’s persistence was no longer present, she would choose to stay even when she knew the risk of being violated by him!’‘Because paying 2.5 million yuan was impossible for her.’‘In addition, if she offended him, she would be afraid that I would truly ban her in the entertainment industry and her dream would never come true….’“So, she will choose to give in.”The more Su Mingyuan spoke, the brighter his eyes became and the more he said, the more he thought his plan was reasonable.‘Even though she submitted under his power once, she has to force herself to give in the second time and so on!’‘This meant…’“I have the ability to control, subvert, and order her.”“I can order her to do whatever I need her to do! For example..in the following plot regarding me and her, that plot of the campus scandal. I can order her to cooperate to finish that plot!“Right, I need to ensure that part of the plot happens. I need Xiao Ruoruo to follow the depiction in the original plot to allow me to perform. But what if her personality changes again?”“Then I will use her changed personality, the character that yields to my power, to persecute her and order her!”‘He will order her in the same manner as the plot. The scene, the location, and order her to act with him on the plot in the novel, so that he could get the best rating, get the highest villain bonus, and complete with a perfect performance!’Su Mingyuan waved his fist excitedly in the air and said, “System, I found a way to break this play!”[As expected of you, host! I knew you would not let me down! ]“And Su Xuelan, my good sister, I also know how to use her.”After solving Xiao Ruoruo’s problem, Su Mingyuan’s mind suddenly came up with another solution.”Since she cares so much about me and feels sorry for me because I am her brother, I’ll take advantage of her kindness and care to let her accompany me in the plot where she should appear, which will not be too difficult, will it?”“What if I use my younger brother status to get her to help you? A younger brother tearfully asks his sister for help and the sister who loves her brother dearly should not refuse fiercely, right? ”“Thinking of it this way, it is not impossible to make up the remaining fifty thousand villain points.”Su Mingyuan’s fighting spirit suddenly rose and he felt that he could do it again.“As long as I pinch their weaknesses and let them cooperate with me to act, maybe soon, in less than half a year, I will be able to save enough money for my travel.”He was full of optimism about this.This world was easy for those who were inclined to do everything.There was nothing that could bring him down, and there was no problem that couldn’t be solved at all.As long as he stays optimistic and doesn’t lose hope, he can always make a bright future for him.As he twirled the wine glass, the wine inside danced as lightly indicating his good mood. He raised the glass to the distant sun.To the sun, to his heart, which was really happy and bright like the sun.Su Mingyuan sorted out his mood and decided that he must come up with the best state of mind tomorrow to meet the next scene.Which should be his second conflict with Xiao Ran. According to the plot of the novel, after Xiao Ran loses his money and leaves, because the beauty did not succeed, he would still feel very unhappy.He remembered that the uniform worn by Xiao Ran was a little familiar, it looked like the uniform of Xuanmei cosmetics company opened by his fiancée Xia Xueqi.He went there the next day to humiliate Xiao Ran and asked Xia Xueqi to fire Xiao Ran on the spot.That was Xiao Ran’s first face-slapping.His fiancée Xia Xueqi not only did not give him face, but also resolutely defended Xiao Ran, asking Su Mingyuan to quickly get out of her company.What Xia Xueqi, as his fiancée, did, not only did not side with him, but she also defended another man not to mention his enemy in front of him!Since Xiao Ruoruo’s softness had altered his plans, it appeared that there was no need for him to pursue Xiao Ran once more. After all, she was too irresistible for any man to resist.But he didn’t care, he was the villain, and he was going to target Xiao Ran.Not targeting Xiao Ran, how could he earn villain points and save enough points to travel home after completing the plot?Although in the previous performance, he only received a passing evaluation, in the next performance, he will attract the audience and complete a perfect performance!He will be rewarded with the highest villain points!There is a way that the world is impermanent, but it is impossible to repeat it. He did not believe that this time, Xia Xueqi’s personality had also changed.God couldn’t have done this to him, could he?“President Su.”At this moment, Xiao Ruoruo’s soft and waxy voice sounded behind him.Su Mingyuan turned around and asked, “What did my Big sister talk with you about just now?”“Big sister Lan didn’t say anything to me, just chatted with me about family affairs.”Big sister Lan…..How long had it been since they met, and they have already become so affectionate.Su Mingyuan didn’t give it a second thought as he stared warily at Xiao Ruoruo.Let’s put Xiao Ruoruo to the test right now, and see if she bowed down to his strength.“Ruoruo, come here.” He made an order hastily.Xiao Ruoruo came over obediently, “President Su, do you have any instructions?”Su Mingyuan rubbed the smooth edge of the glass as if stroking his beauty’s lips. “Ruoruo, do you know what the main job of being my intern secretary is?”“What ……is it?”The glass illuminated by the sun was crystal clear and the golden light and shadow were projected on the mahogany tabletop, and half of Su Mingyuan’s side profile looked more and more handsome in this light and shadow, while the other half of his face looked a little evil in the shadow.“A beautiful girl like you must also be extremely intelligent. You know the women who were my intern secretaries and their fate. Since you chose to stay, you are also prepared in your heart, right?”He put down the crystal clear wine glass and pulled up Xiao Ruoruo’s slender and beautiful hand.And Xiao Ruoruo really didn’t refuse.Compared with the cold glass, this was the real gem of crystal beauty.Firm and smooth skin, fair complexion, slender fingers and soft palms.And such a treasure, such a work of art, was in his hands, and it was up to the king to do anything with it.Seeing Xiao Ruoruo’s reaction, Su Mingyuan was very happyShe was as easy to give in as he had guessed.Great, his plan could go smoothly.“If you are very good, I will take you as a woman who knows current affairs. And I will never treat those who serve me faithfully bad. ”Su Mingyuan was ready to strike the iron while it was hot, and at this moment, he would completely establish the master-slave relationship between Xiao Ruoruo and him.His hand climbed up to Xiao Ruoruo’s cheek and stroked it gently.His tone was gentle and his eyes were gentle too. He was sitting and Xiao Ruoruo was standing, but he looked at her from above her head and said,“If you need money, I have it; if you want to be a dazzling star, then I will use my relationship to push you to the shining stage. Your future, your dreams, everything you desire, I can help you make it happen.”The hand that gently caressed Xiao Ruoruo’s face suddenly exerted force, and those eyes, which were filled with tenderness just now, were also filled with icy majesty in an instant.“Xiao Ruoruo, I can give you everything you want. And all you need to do is to give into me whatever I want completely and obey all my commands, okay?”Xiao Ruoruo grabbed his hand and suddenly smiled.“President Su, I… don’t understand.”
