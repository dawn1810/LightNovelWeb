When the two walked out of the theatre, Su Mingyuan found that his bodyguard Li Cheng had a strange expression, as if he wanted to say something but didn’t dare to say it.So he took the initiative to ask, “Li Cheng, do you have anything to tell me?”“Master, I just received a call. My mother had an acute heart attack, so…”“Have an acute heart attack? Then her old man…”“Fortunately, a kind person gave her CPR and artificial respiration in time, but I’m still a little worried about her…” Li Cheng looked worried and embarrassed.Although he should keep his duty and guard by Su Mingyuan’s side, when such a thing happened to his mother, as a son, he couldn’t help but want to rush over to accompany her.“It’s okay, you go. I still have Zhao Shan here to protect me.” Su Mingyuan waved his hand and approved his departure.“Thank you, sir!”Watching Li Cheng leave, Su Mingyuan’s eyes become a little playful.He had completely determined that the kind person who rescued Li Cheng’s mother was Xiao Ran who didn’t run away!And Li Cheng would soon become another undercover agent of Xiao Ran!It seemed that the will of the world was still pushing the development of the world as close as possible to the original plot.Very good!Now I have Ruo Ruo and Li Cheng under my command. With these two generals here, I will give Xiao Ran some information in the future.Can he still be such a waste that he can’t slap me in the face?But……Since Li Cheng will become Xiao Ran’s undercover agent, when I am intimate with Ruoruo and Xueqi in the future, I must be careful not to be discovered by him. After all, he cannot be allowed to report this matters to Xiao Ran.In this regard, Su Mingyuan didn’t have to worry too much as he had no habit of letting others peep.No matter which heroine he was making out with before, Li Cheng and Zhao Shan, who were bodyguards, did not appear at the scene under his orders, and were far away to be vigilant.Just like the intimate actions between Xia Xueqi and Xia Xueqi in the theatre, the two bodyguards guarding outside didn’t know anything at all, and they didn’t need to know.Of course, even so, in the future, it was inevitable that he would not pay attention to it, and when he became careless, it was very simple to solve this problem.He directly promoted Li Cheng to be his confidant, and from time to time, he was assigned some tasks.Well, fine, let’s arrange it that way.Li Cheng, who has now become my confidant, has neither the time nor the opportunity to peek at the intimacy between me and the other heroines, and once there is any important information, he can immediately know and convey it to Xiao Ran. Isn’t this killing two birds with one stone?I’m so smart!Su Mingyuan was in a good mood now, because not only was he about to add another tiger general to his subordinates, but also with the arrangement he carefully prepared for Xia Xueqi, he believed that no woman would not be moved by such a romantic surprise.No woman could resist a dream scene like that.When he held back in the movie hall just now, he managed to provoke Xia Xueqi’s turbulent emotions and melted the hard frost shell on her surface.The victory of this date was already destined to belong to him!Xia Xueqi was also in a good mood now.In the movie hall just now, she almost couldn’t bear it anymore. While teasing Su Mingyuan, she also stirred up her own inner flame more.It was not that she couldn’t admit defeat.Sometimes she took the initiative to take a step and often achieved miraculous results.She fell in love with Su Mingyuan before he really fell in love with her. She was not his opponent and had no resistance to him.But she held back.Because she knew that next, Mingyuan must have prepared the most grand and romantic surprise for herself.That was when she would voluntarily admit defeat.That was the moment when she took the initiative to offer him a romantic kiss.If she wasn’t in the movie theatre, she would not have held back the initiative to go further with him.Maybe in the future, Mingyuan would feel that she only took such an initiative under the background of the atmosphere at that time, driven by the body’s instinctive desire.Because of this, he might feel that her liking for him was still a little false, and he might even think that she was a little sloppy.Xia Xueqi didn’t want him to think like that.Therefore, the next surprise romance he prepared for her was the best moment to take the initiative to admit defeat.She conceded, she admitted that she was attracted to him and fell in love with him.She couldn’t help but offer him anaffectionate kiss, and he would completely accept and believe this fact, and under her affectionate feelings, his heart would gradually be stained with the colour that belonged to her.At this time, the sky was about to dim, and the gorgeous sunset was burning with all its beauty before the nightfall.“Mingyuan, what’s your next plan?”Su Mingyuan smiled slightly. “Xueqi, have you seen the amusement park at night?”There, a grand and beautiful firework was waiting for a couple who were in love with each other.Su Mingyuan was going to take Xia Xueqi to dinner, and after pouring her some wine, he would take her to the amusement park that was reserved by him.He felt that he would be able to take her down this time!At the same time, Xiao Ran, who was just about to leave the hospital, suddenly learned a piece of good news that instantly made him feel better.“Benefactor, my son just called me and said he wants to see me. Although the time is a bit rushed, he will still bring a thank you gift. If you are free…”Xiao Ran’s steps suddenly stopped and he turned around.“Of course, I’m free now.”He didn’t expect that he would be able to meet Li Cheng so soon and have the opportunity to convince him to become his undercover agent.Sure enough, he, Xiao Ran, had always been favoured and loved by the goddess of luck.The smile on Xiao Ran’s face widened slightly.Just when Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi were having dinner and were about to go to the amusement park after the meal, Xiao Ran and Li Cheng finally met.After accepting his thanks, Xiao Ran took Li Cheng aside and was about to whisper something.In a room of a five-star hotel in Ming City.Liu Mengning casually draped a black gauze skirt and wore headphones, leaning on the sofa lazily and gracefully.She was holding the phone in her hand, and her fingers were constantly sliding on the screen, not knowing what she was looking at.“Mengning, it’s dinner time, what do you want to eat tonight?” Her manager Liu Xi knocked on the door and walked in.Liu Mengning didn’t answer, just pouted her lips slightly, as if she saw something that made her feel unhappy.If Liu Xi walked behind her to observe at this time, she would see that all the videos and comments about Su Mingyuan’s performance as a white knight singing on the flyover were being played on the screen of her mobile phone.And all the music played in her earphones were the songs that Su Mingyuan sang on the flyover recorded by passers-by.***
