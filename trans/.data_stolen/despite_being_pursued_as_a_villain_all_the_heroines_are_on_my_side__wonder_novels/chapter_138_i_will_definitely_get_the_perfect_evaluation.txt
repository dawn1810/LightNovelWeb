It was already dark when Su Mingyusn arrived home.However, he could see that the villa was still lit up.Ruoruo was still waiting for him in her pajamas and didn’t sleep.The stars in the dark night stood out more prominently, but Ruoruo’s eyes outshone all of them.“Brother Mingyuan, you’re back!”Whenever he came back from outside, he could always hear her energetic voice.It was precisely because of her existence that, in this huge and cold villa, he could feel an aura of life.When he went back to the villa before, he only saw it as a place to sleep.This week, however, whenever he returned and met Ruoruo’s gentle eyes and heard her greeting like a virtuous wife, he felt a burst of peace and tranquility in his heart. The sensation was as if he had returned to his own home.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comHome……“Ruoruo, it’s getting late; go to bed first.” Su Mingyuan gently rubbed her hair and smiled.“Okay! Brother Mingyuan, you should get some rest as well; good night!” Ruoruo returned to her room after nodding obediently.She was always so obedient.Even though she smelled a faint scent on Su Mingyuan’s body, she didn’t ask anything. She was used to it anyway.After all, every time Su Mingyuan came back from the outside, he had the smell of other sisters on his body.Brooding on such trivial matters would only make her feel more uneasy.It was better to find a way to overcome her shyness in order to launch a more daring attack on Brother Mingyuan in the future.‘Maybe, if I get a chance, I can spend time with my brother Mingyuan.’Ruoruo thought about it, and her little face turned red again. She shyly pulled up the quilt, covered her little face, wanting to hide her existence.Su Mingyuan went upstairs to take a shower, laid on the bed with a refreshed body, and closed his eyes.Nevertheless, for some reason, the scent of the cherry candy still appeared to linger at the tip of his nose.It must be an illusion.It is all because of Liu Mengning, this charming little goblin. She is so beautiful that I cannot forget how she tastes.Tonight, Ruoruo couldn’t help being a bad boy again in her charming fantasy.And Su Mingyuan had a bizarre dream as well.Liu Mengning, the charming and seductive goblin, was the first female protagonist in the dream, followed by Ruoruo and Xueqi. Hongxue also appeared, and in the distance, even the hazy form of his sister Su Xuelan could be seen to appear…Early the next morning.I’m so sleepy!Su Mingyuan looked at the rising sun outside the window and patted his head.But the weather was nice today, which was a good sign that his performance would also go off without a hitch and end well.When washing in front of the mirror, Su Mingyuan found that the scar on his lips from last night had disappeared, and the faint cherry scent lingering on the tip of his nose could not be detected.Great, everything worked fine!What he didn’t know was that when a person stayed in a room full of another scent for a long time, he would gradually become unaware of the existence of this fragrance.And this light cherry smell lingered on the tip of his nose all night, but his mind didn’t notice it unless someone pointed it out to him.Su Mingyuan shook his head, forgetting the absurd dream last night, and cheered up.‘Today was a very important day, and it would lead to a new beginning.’Xiao Ran, Liu Mengning, and Xueqi’s side were all taken care of by him in advance. Under his arrangement, these actors understood what they should do today.Additionally, he completely excluded off-site factors like Hongxue and her older sister from this performance. If they were obedient, they would definitely not cause trouble.It could be said that all the variables had been calculated by him, and all the preparations for the stage layout had been completed under his hard work. Now, he was only waiting for actors to appear.This time, the show is going to be lit.When Su Mingyuan thought of this, his mood brightened, so much that he didn’t notice Ruoruo’s slight change in expression after approaching him.The smell on Brother Mingyuan…Is it the smell that the sister left on him last night? Or is it just me thinking too much? This must be the scent that the body wash left behind.After Su Mingyuan came back last night, Ruoruo only greeted him from a little distance, so she didn’t perceive the smell on his body too deeply. At that time, she was a little uncertain.Moreover, the smell on his body was very light, unless she was very close to distinguish it. If Ruoruo had not struggled too long on such a trivial matter.This made Su Mingyuan miss the last chance to make up for the flaw.He was in a good mood now and was very excited. When he thought that he could finally get a high rating from the system with the huge increase in villain points and strengthening points, he couldn’t wait to speed up the time and fast-forward to the show.So much so that he subconsciously ignored the surprise mentioned by Liu Mengning before parting last night.Surprise?Since she said it was a surprise for Xiao Ran, then she probably gave him a cameo role as in the original novel?Then, when Xiao Ran happened to follow the filming location to shoot a movie, he would trigger a quest in the secret pool of Xueling, and get the mysterious ice lotus.Su Mingyuan didn’t think much about it. Xiao Ran did not save Liu Mengning twice this week, and to her, he was just a minor stranger.He even thought that Liu Mengning probably gave Xiao Ran such a surprise because of him. Besides, what other surprises could she give Xiao Ran?Looking for Xiao Ran to invest and cooperate in the next film?Anyway, Su Mingyuan didn’t bother to think about it. Liu Mengning’s surprise for Xiao Ran would only further enhance Xiao Ran’s coercive effect, and, at the same time, bring him a higher evaluation and more villain points.In other words, this time, in order to ensure a smooth and perfect performance, he walked among the female protagonists without hesitation, deepened his feelings for them, and became intimate with…He had given so much.What else could he possibly do?Now, he deserved the most villain points in this show, and he deserved a perfect rating!How would he lose this time?When previous performances didn’t go well, it was either because of the female leads or Xiao Ran.Now that all the problems had been cleared up and solved by him in advance, the stage had been set up, and the actors had been adjusted to their positions. How could he lose?At dusk, the fiery setting sun wrapped in red clouds slowly hit the horizon.However, Su Mingyuan felt that the scenery was extremely beautiful, as if God were doing it for him.About six o’clock in the evening, a Rolls-Royce stopped at the Park Hyatt Hotel’s entrance.A lavish dinner would be held at the top of the five-star hotel. It was the investment dinner held by Liu Mengning to prepare for the new film and recruit investors.Su Mingyuan took Ruoruo out of the car in high spirits, looked at the magnificent sky above his head, and strode into the hotel door with his head held high.Tonight, Su Mingyuan would definitely win the perfect evaluation for this performance!***
