Looking at Xiao Ruoruo’s passive demeanor, Su Mingyuan felt that his prior suspicions about Xiao Ruoruo being the undercover agent was not entirely incorrect.The reason why she refused to confess to him was because she was the undercover agent Xiao Ran had placed on his side.So of course, she wouldn’t tell what she was up to.Thinking of this, Su Mingyuan took a deep breath.Sigh…..‘Xiao Ruoruo’s lips taste made him feel nostalgic.’‘He rested his head on her thighs, which felt rather comfortable. Her massage was also excellent.’‘But…’‘Even though there is something wrong with Xiao Ruoruo’s character, she is still Xiao Ran’s younger sister who will think of him.’‘Besides, she is one of the female protagonists in this world, as a member of Xiaoran’s future harem, she has her heart set on the novel’s protagonist, Xiao Ran.’‘That’s right’.‘It’s impossible for her to say she liked him.’‘Ugh, this really made him ……’‘It really made him…’‘feel…’‘great!’This is simply great!’Since Xiao Ruoruo still had Xiao Ran in her heart, the world may not have collapsed completely and it would be easier for him to bring the chaotic plot back to the right track!Su Mingyuan feared that each female protagonist’s character had changed drastically, making them dislike Xiao Ran.Knowing there’s a lot behind the plot for the conflict between him, Xiao Ran and Xiao Ran’s harem. If these female protagonists didn’t like Xiao Ran and wouldn’t fall in love with Xiao Ran, he wouldn’t know how to correct the plot!The system didn’t sell love potions either!But it’s okay, although the female protagonist’s attitude had changed, as long as there was no major ruination, there would still be a solution.And it had to be said, Xiao Ruoruo thought about Xiao Ran like this, but for him, she had to sacrifice her beauty to him…How come…sounds a bit disgusting.Anyhow…Su Mingyuan got a little excited.“Brother Mingyuan, don’t be angry, I really have a reason why I can’t say it.”Seeing Su Mingyuan’s gloomy face for a moment, Xiao Ruoruo felt slightly uncomfortable, tugging at the sleeve of his coat, she said, “Anyway, I really won’t hurt you, brother Mingyuan.”“Will not harm me?”Su Mingyuan instinctively held her hand and caressed it in his palm. While stroking her hand, he said, “So, you still care for my own good?”When confronted with Su Mingyuan’s finger stroking, Xiao Ruoruo reddened abnormally.“Um…um.”“Ruoruo, since you’re doing it for my own good, then if one day your brother Xiao Ran and I have a conflict at the same time, who would you…help?”A fatal question.Xiao Ruoruo was suddenly stunned.Of course she would choose to help Su Mingyuan, but how could she justify at this time, her personality and her identity, that she was not helping Xiao Ran?Moreover, even within the two parties, Su Mingyuan and Xiao Ran, if she said she would choose to help brother Mingyuan, will brother Mingyuan …… believe her?He would just think that her confession was playing him like a fool, and now she said such an answer.She was afraid that she would become a bad woman who was full of lies in his mind.She didn’t want to leave such an image in the heart of brother Mingyuan.So, Xiao Ruoruo remained silent for a long time.“I…I don’t know.”She lowered her head and gave such an indecisive answer.However, in Su Mingyuan’s eyes, this hesitant answer was an answer in itself.In other words, when he had the idea that Xiao Ruoruo was most likely Xiao Ran’s undercover agent, he became more and more certain of this idea.No matter what Xiao Ruoruo answered, his brain would automatically deduce the result to the side he wants.“Forget it if you don’t know, but Ruoruo, here I want to tell you something.”Su Mingyuan said slowly in her ear, “I just suddenly remembered the clothes your brother was wearing. It is the special uniform of the cosmetics company my fianceé owns.”“Although you chose to stay and be my secretary for him, I’m not going to let him go.”“Tomorrow, I’m going to go to Xuan Mei and have my fiancée fire him in front of everyone!”“But you don’t have to worry.”He put Xiao Ruoruo’s small palm in his palm, warm and forceful,“Because of your good behaviour, as long as he accepts, If he doesn’t come down and mess with me, then I won’t bother to touch him again. I’ll just let him lose his job…”“…Do you feel bad?”After he finished speaking, he suddenly released Xiao Ruoruo’s hand, got up aggressively and walked away, disappearing at the door, leaving Xiao Ruoruo ruthlessly in the restaurant alone.One second he was threatening in a gentle voice, and the next second he left her coldly and ruthlessly. The sudden turn of events, so fast that Xiao Ruoruo was a bit caught off guard.Meanwhile, Su Mingyuan had already dashed up to the second floor, entered the monitoring room and opened the monitoring screen.This was another one of his trials.To test whether Xiao Ruoruo would convey this information to Xiao Ran.In the restaurant.The temperature in the palm of her hand was fleeting, Xiao Ruoruo sat silently for a while, then suddenly got up and went back to the room.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comBrother Mingyuan gave her a strong sense of oppression just now. Not only was he holding her hand with force, but also in his words and eyes, there was an unusual sharpness piercing at her.Like forcing her to make a choice right away.She knew when she came here that brother Mingyuan would definitely be suspicious of her because of her different behaviour, but it doesn’t matter.As long as Xiao Ran was dead and the truth was revealed, then brother Mingyuan would understand that her love for him was all true. He would know that everything she did was really for his own good.How profound the misunderstanding was at the moment determined how profound the emotion would be in the subsequent time.And she, as the woman who was with him from the very beginning and had been with him ever since, certainly would thus win his ultimate love.Besides, whether it was brother Mingyuan who was sternly interrogating her and showing his domineering attitude or the brother Mingyuan who showed a shocked expression because of her abnormal behaviour. She liked it very much.Strong and domineering, stunned and panic, both of which made her fascinated.And now, she was going to go back to the room to contact her real brother Xiao Ran and tell him what Su Mingyuan was going to the company for tomorrow.After all, the reason she offered to convince Xiao Ran was that she volunteered to be his undercover agent.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comAnd this type of information, which would be destined to happen but has no effect on brother Mingyuan, could be utilized to consolidate Xiao Ran’s trust.This way, Xiao Ran would be more at ease with her, trust her more wholeheartedly. In case something happened in the future, he would not hide it from her.If Xiao Ran secretly arranged a plan for brother Mingyuan in the future, she would know it as soon as possible. She would notify Big sister Lan, so that brother Mingyuan can eliminate the danger in advance before he could even realise that the danger was coming.Thinking of this, Xiao Ruoruo picked up her phone and dialed Xiao Ran’s number.***
