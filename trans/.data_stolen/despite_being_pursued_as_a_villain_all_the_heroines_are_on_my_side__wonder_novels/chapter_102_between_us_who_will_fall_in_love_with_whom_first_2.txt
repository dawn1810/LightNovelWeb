She usually doesn’t smile, and her expression and eyes were so cold. At this moment, she suddenly made such a giggling sound, which made Su Mingyuan’s heart beat faster.“I agree to the alliance and tomorrow’s date. Mingyuan, you know, I’m looking forward to it now, looking forward to who will fall in love with the other first…”Xia Xueqi’s voice suddenly became vivid and attractive at this moment, like an melting iceberg, finally revealing the hidden charm.“You have to cheer up, because now I…”Her tone was lazy and slender, with a hint of seductive charm, like a succubus softly breathing in your ear, “…I’m a little bit tempted by you already.”Su Mingyuan never thought that an iceberg beauty like Xia Xueqi would suddenly show such a coquettish attitude to him, even if it was just such a flirtatious tone and voice, he couldn’t help but react for a while.What a seductive fairy!But Xia Xueqi, you probably don’t know yet, you have fallen into my trap!What alliance? Just bullshit.I just want to use the excuse of forming an alliance to get in touch with you more and see if I can take you down.Even if you can’t, because of your ally, I have helped you, so you help me during my performance, don’t make trouble, this is also right?I won’t lose anything!Hahaha, that moment when you agreed to date me and form an alliance with me.Xia Xueqi, you have already been completely calculated by me, and you can’t escape my palm no matter what!On the other side, Xia Xueqi, who hung up the phone, took a deep breath, and a beautiful blush appeared on her delicate snow-white face.Mingyuan’s self-inflicted entrapment really made her almost unable to hold back her personality as an iceberg beauty, so happy that she burst out laughing.After forming the alliance, wouldn’t she have more opportunities and reasons to ask Mingyuan out?And there was no need to make any lousy excuses for being forced by the family.And, since it was the call of allies, it was business.In the future, when those bad women want to find Mingyuan on a date, I will call Mingyuan and say that I have something serious to discuss with you, so Mingyuan will have to leave them behind and come to me to discuss business with me first?Shouldn’t we have a meeting after the business is over?After all, this is what you said that you want to kiss me and make me fall in love with you.Xia Xueqi originally thought that she was really going to have bad luck today. First, Xiao Ran almost tried to hold hands, and then she got angry at Murong Hongxue.Unexpectedly, she was the one who was truly blessed by luck!Mingyuan took the initiative to call to invite me on a date, and he even took the initiative to make a declaration that he wanted to pursue me and make me fall in love with him…Can the rest of you women do it?Can you?What’s the use of your crooked ways?Only my strategy method is the real kingly way, and it is the bright road to attack Mingyuan’s heart in a dignified manner!Plus, with my fiance status blessing.Heh, not only will I have the last laugh.I am now ahead of all of you!The corners of Xia Xueqi’s mouth rose sharply.This time, she really couldn’t help laughing out loud.By the way, since I am going to have a date with Mingyuan tomorrow, let’s not forget to arrange it in advance.She will never let go of every opportunity to enhance her relationship with Mingyuan.Those arrangements that I didn’t have time to use last time seem to come in handy this time.…………Su Mingyuan hung up the phone, the excitement and smile on his face didn’t last long, he lowered his head and noticed Ruoruo’s lost expression in his arms.Ruoruo was originally very happy, because this time brother Mingyuan came back from the outside, and there was no other woman’s smell on his body.Although it was because Su Mingyuan had been wandering outside for too long, he was singing on the overpass, and he was playing chess with the old man, and the smell of Murong Hongxue had almost dissipated.He even changed the white knight suit before going home. How could he still smell like a woman?But, if she didn’t expect that she was still in brother Mingyuan’s arms, brother Mingyuan, who took over the phone, talked with sister Xueqi in front of her, and discussed a date tomorrow.#pleasereadthischapteratwondernovels.comRuoruo pouted unhappily and became shrivelled, and her watery eyes were full of disappointment.How could Su Mingyuan make his Ruoruo good baby unhappy?He quickly comforted Ruoruo, pinched her little face, scratched her nose, and tried to make her happy.He was thinking in his heart:Since I want to find a way to win Xia Xueqi, then I should arrange and prepare for tomorrow’s appointment in advance. I must arrange it clearly and get a high score in one fell swoop.Women, maybe they don’t care, but who doesn’t like surprises and romance?Coincidentally, Su Mingyuan, who had been an actor and a director, said that he still had good experience in this regard.He had already figured out how to arrange a romantic scene.
