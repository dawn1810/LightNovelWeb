What the hell!Xia Xueqi, you are too brave!Hearing Xia Xueqi’s words, Su Mingyuan was taken aback.Although he also wanted to see Xiao Ran’s bitter face, he was also afraid of provoking him too much, causing him to go mad on the spot.So I just came up to say hello, and didn’t say much sarcasm to ridicule him.Although in Xiao Ran’s mind, his words of greeting had been automatically made up as the ultimate provocation.However, Su Mingyuan still did not expect that Xia Xueqi would be even more brilliant and brave than him!In front of Xiao Ran, she was not allowed to call her Xueqi!Xiao Ran’s face instantly turned ugly as pig liver.Compared to Su Mingyuan’s surprise, his whole body felt as if his heart had been pierced by a sharp arrow, and at this moment, endless painful blood spurted out.If he could have comforted himself just now, telling himself that Su Mingyuan was impotent, and Xueqi was just acting, but Xia Xueqi’s words, this cold and disgusting look, was a thunderbolt, which mercilessly shattered his defence.“For… why…”He looked at Xia Xueqi in disbelief and pain.The clenched fist couldn’t be clenched anymore, because the blow was too great and the pain was too deep, he even stumbled back a step, almost unsteady.Could it be… Could it be that Xue Qi’s disgusting face was never shown to Su Mingyuan, but… to me?No, not possible!This must be fake!Otherwise, why did Xueqi smile at me before?Why choose me to be her partner?Xiao Ran couldn’t believe all this.He didn’t want to believe it all.Because he was forced by Su Xuelan to slap himself in public, he could bear it.He was pressured by the Su Xia family to apologise to Su Mingyuan, he could bear it.But what she did, if his infatuation with Xia Xueqi was just a joke…Xiao Ran didn’t dare to think about it any longer.He didn’t want to, and couldn’t think about it any longer.This kind of thing must be impossible, must be false.Yes, fake, everything is fake.Xueqi’s words are false!Yes… She was acting on purpose to show Su Mingyuan, that’s why she said this!Right, that is it!It must be so!It sure is!I called Xue Qi so many times before, but she never showed this expression, and most importantly, I remembered:She was the one who took the initiative to ask me to call it like that!Now the reason why she is so resistant to this title, so disgusted, is because Su Mingyuan is by her side, and she wants to show Su Mingyuan!Xiao Ran suddenly opened his mind and felt that he had found the reason why Xia Xueqi treated him like this, and found the real correct solution.Xueqi’s disgusting face, although it is aimed at me, is actually aimed at Su Mingyuan!She is protecting me, and she is using this attitude to prove to Su Mingyuan that there is no ambiguity between me and her except for the partnership relationship, and we are  innocent.In this way, Su Mingyuan will have no excuse to go to his family to support him and target me, so that my power can continue to develop.It must be so! That’s right!Xueqi was just acting, she was protecting me!The more Xiao Ran thought about it, the more he felt that this inference was correct.The collapsed state of mind was rehabilitated at this moment. He clenched his fists hard, stood firm, and looked at Xia Xueqi again, eager to get an explanation from her mouth, eager to get an answer from her eyes.However, Xia Xueqi was too lazy to look at him again, so as not to dirty her eyes. She took Su Mingyuan’s hand and walked into the theatre’s projection hall.“Mingyuan, let’s go, there’s no need to delay our movie watching because of him.”Su Mingyuan was also afraid that Xia Xueqi would say a few more words, which would stimulate Xiao Ran’s anger to the point of breaking through the boundaries of reason, and began to disregard all the rules and taboos to choose to kill. He ignored Xiao Ran and left.Su Mingyuan’s attitude was irrelevant to Xiao Ran, and was not worth mentioning, but Xia Xueqi ignored his appearance like this, making the heart that he had just lifted was about to be revived. fall into the abyss.Could my guess just now… be wrong?Is it…No, not possible!Impossible!My guess just now must be correct!The reason why Xueqi didn’t respond to me was because she was still acting hard. She didn’t want to be seen by Su Mingyuan in the slightest, she was protecting me, it must be like this!At this moment, with a “Ding” sound, he received a text message on his mobile phone.Is it…Xiao Ran hurriedly took out his mobile phone, as if he had obtained a life-saving straw.This news was sent by Xia Xueqi.[Be careful, this place is surrounded by people from the Su Xia family.]It was just a simple and ordinary sentence, but at this moment, Xiao Ran’s heart, which was about to fall into the abyss, flew into the sky again, feeling the sunshine of redemption.I knew it! I knew it!I knew Xueqi was just acting!How could she show disgust and disgust at me?How could she not allow me to call her Xueqi?Everything is because she is dating Su Mingyuan under the surveillance of the Su Xia family, so she can’t show any kind attitude towards me.Even in order to protect me, she had to endure the disgusting pain of being held by Su Mingyuan, and perform such a performance that went against her heart!And I almost blamed her just now, thinking she…Hehe, now that I think about it, I know that this situation is impossible.Has Su Mingyuan seen Xueqi’s smile? Has he been asked by her to call her by such an intimate name as Xueqi?Does he not? How could he possibly have?And these, but all actually happened to me, the experience I have had!At this moment, Xiao Ran’s heart revivedagain, full of high-spirited fighting spirit.At this moment, his heart was also filled with regret, emotion and worry for Xia Xueqi, and it really hurt him…At this moment, the conductor of this movie theatre came over and said, “I’m sorry, this gentleman. Actually, I just wanted to come over to remind you that our movie theatre has been reserved today, and we will not sell tickets to anyone.”After being reminded by Xia Xueqi’s text message, Xiao Ran already understood at this time that this cinema was now all from the Su Xia family!What the conductor just said to him actually implied: Today is an important date for our young master Su and Miss Xia, why are you still here and hurrying up?Sure enough, the Su Xia family attached great importance to the marriage between Xueqi and Su Caobao, and they sent someone to surveil and protect them last time, and this time too.Fortunately, Xueqi just protected me, and I didn’t have any impulse, otherwise, these two families would have another excuse to attack me.Okay, want to let me go, okay?I go!Xiao Ran gritted his teeth and glared at the conductor angrily, staring at the other person a little bit inexplicably. He couldn’t help but mutter a “neuropathy” in his heart, but he still didn’t leave.#PLEASEREADTHISCHAPTERATWONDERNOVELS.COMHe turned his head, until he saw Su Mingyuan and Xia Xueqi walking into the theatre, and their bodyguards stood respectfully and loyally guarding the door, then he clenched his fists helplessly and resentfully, turned around and left.Although he knew that Xueqi would work hard to protect himself and not let Su Mingyuan take advantage, and although he knew that Su Mingyuan was impotent, the dark environment in the cinema…Who knows if that bastard Su Mingyuan will take the opportunity to do something to Xueqi!
