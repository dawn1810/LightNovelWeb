At this moment, outside the restaurant by the small lake…There were two people trembling with anger.One was Nick.While the other was…At first, Nick’s blood boiled when he saw Su Mingyuan pulling Xia Xueqi into his arms.Because, in his eyes, this ugly dude was attempting to violate his boss’ woman!He couldn’t help but want to rush out.But then, he soon witnessed a scene that was even more shocking.Xia Xueqi, the eldest lady of the Xia family and the woman of boss Xiao Ran, actually took the initiative to lean towards the lips of that ugly dude, Su Mingyuan!As he was too far away, the angle was somewhat off from where he stood.So, he thought that Xia Xueqi took the initiative to kiss Su Mingyuan — when in reality, she just leaned in towards his ear!Oh, fuck!As a woman admired by the boss, you are so shameless to kiss that hideous Su!No, if I think about it carefully, maybe this woman doesn’t even like the boss at all — everything she shows in front of him is just pretence.Nick was fuming with rage.#please this chapter at wondernovels.comHe couldn’t wait to pull out the gun hidden in his pocket and shoot those bitches on the spot.Due to China’s strict gun control, mercenaries from other countries were not allowed to carry guns or ammo, however, as long as parts and accessories were available, these elite mercenaries could easily assemble a weapon by themselves.Once they arrived, they purchased numerous parts from the Ming City’s underground black market and assembled a dozen of guns on their own.The gun hidden in Nick’s pants happened to be one of them.The intimate sight of Xia Xueqi and Su Mingyuan at that very moment made him livid. He put his hand on his waist and almost pulled out his gun, planning to kill those bitches to avenge Xiao Ran.But, he hadn’t completely lost his mind.“No, this needs to be reported to the boss first…”He took out his phone and prepared to inform Xiao Ran about the situation.However, suddenly, a cold voice echoed from behind.“Report to Xiao Ran, huh? I’m afraid you don’t have such an opportunity anymore.”He felt severe pain on his back, followed by his internal organs being torn by the fierce slice of a sharp knife.Nick’s vision went black as his body fell limply on the ground. He let out a muffled grunt before his life was extinguished. Until the moment of death, he did not even know who attacked him from behind…He only knew that the killer had a feminine voice that was both very attractive and very…Cruel and ruthless.She ordered her men to dispose of his body as she wiped her hands with a white handkerchief, embroidered with exquisite flowers. When her eyes caught the sight of those two being lovey-dovey inside the restaurant, she couldn’t help but clench her fists, crumpling the handkerchief in her hand as she did so.Xia Xueqi was pleasantly enjoying herself when she could’ve been the one there…Su Xuelan gritted her teeth, silently enduring the resentment she felt, and furiously exclaimed in her mind:‘You sluts! None of you will be allowed to contact Mingyuan tomorrow.’‘Because tomorrow, I will have Mingyuan all to myself!’…………In the restaurant.When Su Mingyuan tried to take Xia Xueqi into his arms, he let go of her instantly.#please this chapter at wondernovels.comIn this way, he wouldn’t be regarded as deliberately assaulting the heroine — but he didn’t expect Xia Xueqi to fall into his arms when he accidentally used some strength!‘Look, I let go of her hand. I didn’t mean this to happen.’‘This was all just a misunderstanding, I’m really innocent, System!’‘Believe me!’The system did not deduct his Villain Points. Xia Xueqi, who really didn’t expect him to let her go with such strength, actually fell again.She was so surprised that half of her body fell into his arms.But then, Su Mingyuan’s hand slowly climbed up to her slender waist.Violation, in some cases, was a very ambiguous word.Just like now.Xia Xueqi was already in his arms, which was equivalent to being held by him.So, could it still be considered a violation if he went ahead and put his hand on her waist?This obviously did not count!Su Mingyuan, who had already kissed Ruoruo a few times, understood this well.When Ruoruo kissed him before, he kissed her back with more intensity. Even if their lips parted, they would press together again just a second later, so it was impossible to identify who was at fault and who was not. By that, his Villain Points were never deducted by the system.It appeared that because Ruoruo initiated the kiss, the system considered her to be the one who was at fault for the entire incident.If he wasn’t the one who initiated it, the Villain Points would not be deducted.It wouldn’t be considered a violation.Su Mingyuan once again confirmed this vague conjecture on Xia Xueqi’s body at that time.He was keenly observing as his fingers began to move flexibly over her waist, rubbing against the fabric of her thin clothing.Xia Xueqi’s earlobes went slightly red.“Xueqi, don’t you want to take pictures on your date with me? Why don’t you take out your phone now?”Su Mingyuan pressed his lips beside her reddish earlobe and gently blew hot air.Xia Xueqi shivered slightly in his arms, her ears becoming even redder. While Su Mingyuan grew agitated by the soft feeling of her skin through the thin fabric.‘Oh my, still pretending to be unaffected.’‘Turns out that this is your sensitive spot.’He blew softly towards her earlobe again, feeling the slight shivers of the beauty in his arms with amusement. A smile of satisfaction arose from the corners of his mouth.“Xueqi, why aren’t you moving? Go on, pull your phone out and take a picture.”“Or perhaps…”His voice became low and wicked as he blew beside her earlobe again and said, “…You’ve spent all your strength trying to maintain that poker face?”His deft fingers kept on rubbing against her slim waist as his lips rested on her ear, proceeding to blow gently once more.He said to her, “Xueqi, don’t you know that the person leaning into my arms right now… is you?”With his smug laughter ringing in her ears, Xia Xueqi could no longer keep her cold expression.A charming blush spread across her cheeks, like a stone that had fallen into a calm lake, creating pink ripples.***
